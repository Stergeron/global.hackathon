Tell us why you want to win.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Don't reveal too much about your project, this is a competition but maybe
you can tell us the technologies, APIs you are going to use and what kind
of application you are going to build.

You can change your mind, that's ok. Just push an update here when you do.

I've been writing code for the web in one form or another since before there were any books on it.  I'd head to one of the 300 or so pages Yahoo had at the time, save it, change something, reload, and squeal with delight at what I learned to do that day.  These days, it's a career, but the passion hasn't waned one bit.

I spent many years toiling away for up to 100 hours a week with my own company, trying to just keep the lights on and the team paid and neglecting my own growth.  In the past couple years, I've regained my focus and thirst for new knowledge and languages.  I joined this hackathon because I want to challenge myself and play with new APIs... and I've had this site idea in my head for a while that matches one of the themes perfectly.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm still fine-tuning my Javascript skills, but my long-time passion and strength is in PHP.  I've also been productive in Perl, Python, ASP and Java, and I'm getting my head around Node and Erlang.

I won't say much about the project and the APIs I plan to use as I feel it might give too much away, but I will say that I think it will be pretty far apart from what other teams will be doing.  You'll just have to wait and see.

# Hello!
We are team 0x1A4. We are all juniors attending the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

## Rachel

**Bio: **I'd say my life went pretty smoothly the first 14 or so years. Nearly everything was handed to me -- a loving family, close friends, and the like. It wasn't until high school that I realized I had faced almost no challenges. You might be thinking, "Well, isn't that a good thing?" And honestly, it was. I lived in a little bubble where nothing could touch me. This wasn't limited to traumas, though. I had minimal contact with the outside world, and, at the time, I didn't find anything odd about this. When I entered high school, I met people who knew things -- people who had been interacting with other people all over the world, and they did it right from a computer. Ah, a computer. It was with great reluctance that I accepted my first computer two months into freshman year. I didn't think I needed one, but little did I know, it would later become my greatest asset.

Freshman year. Foundations of Computer Science -- a required course, ironically. What did I know about coding? What did I _want_ to know about coding? A lot, as it turns out. I won't lie -- it took me a while to get used to the format of computer science. Logic, though. Logic, I loved, and I came to love the straightforwardness of computer science. Now, only 2 short years later, I'm taking advanced CS courses and hoping to become a computer science major. 

**Skills: **

I am fairly good at front-end development, and proficient at back-end.

## Rohan

**Bio:**

 I distinctly remember my first encounter with coding. In 6th grade, my teacher assigned a webpage to showcase the work we had created throughout the year. While we could just use a website builder, I was enticed by the raw power of creation I could achieve through coding; I remember borrowing stacks of books on HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to learn how to make cool animations and effects. While in hindsight it was just a simple website, really did change my life by exposing me to coding. Since then, I've taken all the advanced CS courses I could take, from AP Computer Science to Artificial Intelligence. What isn't offered in class, I have strived to learn on my own. This hackathon is a perfect opportunity to develop my programming skills and apply them to real world challenges

**Skills:**

While relatively new to web development, I have experience in scientific computing in Python. I am proficient in front-end development and android, but am still learning back-end.

## Sashank Thupukari

**Bio:**

 I enjoy web development and going to hackathons

**Skills:**

Programming/Markup Languages: Javascript (+node.js),  Python, PHP, Java, Swift, HTML/CSS

Best at: Backend Web Development, Design

The goal of my project is to show how simplicity and composability can
be used to create extensible, scalable, flexible, small, and fast
software. This corresponds to theme 2 for the hackathon, and there,
maybe, will be a game ^^.

# 41 North Studios LLC

My name is Jim Armstrong, and I am the president of 41 North Studios LLC, a small web-design and programming agency
located in Norwalk, CT, USA.

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. I want to challenge myself and see if I can 
take a concept from idea to execution in 48 hours by myself. Above all, I'm hoping to have some fun, learn some 
new things, and be amazed at what everyone creates!

## My favorite languages

I mostly code in C#, Java, and Ruby. For this project I will likely default to Ruby since I am confortable with it 
and think my development time will be faster. However, depending on what I decide to build I may just try a language 
I'm not as familiar with to make this a good learning experience.

55by19Koders

We are programmers working on our day jobs writing software,web apps, scripts,android apps et al. But there is something about
writing code that you really want to write, stuff that you try and build ( stuff that you dream off) in your free time.
This is what we would like to do, doing it in a time constraint environment, so as to have a minimum viable solution working
in quick time.

What are we going to do?

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We love data and how to visualise it, we live in a world
where increasingly we are collecting data for various purposes, right from selling adverts to doing health research. This hack weekend
gives us a great opportunity to play with various APIs and build something useful off them.

Why are we participating?

This is our first hackathon per see. We just want to have a blast trying to do stuff , that we really would like to do. Period!


---------------------------------------

## Who are we?

We're the founders of [720developments.com](http://720developments.com), as you can see if you google us, we're a engaged couple that is working with web developments together since we're just 21 years old (and dating since we're just 17). 7 years later since we starting on our own, we are still here, doing the same but in more interesting projects, trying to learn as much as we can in our free time, and trying to travel as much as we can with our budget.
Also we love to eat, drink good beer (we may start making our own next year) and walk long distances talking about, well... anything, with our 3 little dogs next to us.

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://github.com/francorisso/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/720devs/team.jpg' alt='720 Developments Team'/>

## What are we going to do?
**Theme:** As for the moment of the themes been launched, we choose *Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization*, however, after looking at the APIs, we decided to create a learning tool based in free videos from Youtube users. The theme is HTML5 games, but as we don't do HTML5 games (and we really really want to develop this idea), we've created a web based tool that fetches videos of your interests from Youtube related to Freebase topics focused on education and hobbies. 

We believe the future of education is in the web, and with this project we want to take advantage of Freebase database and the connection the Google guys have been made with the Youtube API and show great content to the end users, as right now Youtube is not very friendly for using as learning tool.

Also we complemented this with some other information from Freebase to get education topics related to the topic you want to learn, for example: books, films and careers. Maybe your hobby can become your career, and this is the real reason behind this project.

## Hobbies and Careers
The project called Hobbies and Careers not just wants to create a learning source from youtube, but also contribute to Freebase to get better relationships between topics and videos. That's why we have created the possibility of add boards for the users to save their favorite videos, kinda like Pinterest does, and after when we have lot of users, we will start clustering this information and send relationship requests between videos and topics to Youtube. 

Also the plan is to improve this to create a more broad system of recommendations (Universities, Professors, People to follow in the social media, etc). But oh well, 2 days is a limited time hehe. I hope you can enjoy our system as we enjoy doing it.

## Why are we participating?
Is the first time in a hackathon together, and the reasons are several, I'll enumerate the most important ones:

* We have a bit more of time this year, and we think is a fun way to spend a weekend.
* We think we're in a good moment as developers to do something great in just 2 days. 
* We get surprised by the big amount of APIs out there with awesome information, and is a good excuse to play with them.
* We will love to show our work to the great jury, having some chance to get to talk with some of them, is really the great prize of this competition.

## Technologies used

We are the hackaton newbies Alton and Adrienne (A&A) and we are so excited for our first hackaton experience! With a small team consisting of just two members, we push ourselves to work as efficiently as possible. Our goal is to learn as much as possible while having a great time. We are so excited to sit infront of a computer for 48 hours going through what Adrienne calls a roller coaster ride; Excitiment from working code and fustration from errors and bugs.

Alton
=======
I'm Alton and I love coding. I am an engineering student at the University of Waterloo following my dreams to learn more about computers. I have prior experience in Python, Turing, C#, SQL, as well as PHP and more expertise in Java, Java-Android, Objective C, HTML, and CSS. I am currently learning Javascript to complement my knowledge in HTML and CSS for this hackaton. Besides coding, I am an avid swimmer and I also like to tell really lame jokes. What's brown and sticky? Hint: It's not what you think it is.  

By the way, life is like a mushroom.


Adrienne
=======
Hi, I'm Adrienne! I am relatively new to programming and looking forward to an awesome learning experience through the global hackaton, with the help of my team leader and super awesome coder, Alton! Inspired by him, I started to learn programming about a year ago. I now have some basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, C++, and MATLAB. Because of my grown appreciation for programming, I am now a transfer student in Systems Design Engineering at the Univesrity of Waterloo where I learn how to encoroprate design aspects in all my projects. Besides programming, I LOVE TO DANCE! If you don't see me studying or coding, then I'm either in a studio or on stage dancing! The above picture of me was take from a show back in 2013 broadcasted on Fairchild TV. 

Code. Dance. Love. Live. 




Languages We Love

for almost all type of platforms, Mobile, Desktop and Web.

Well, No one was lucky enough to take the credit of teaching & training me in the fields of mine expertise and proficiency, 
which is is very diversified, as you can conclude from the above.

You can checkout my odesk profile for skill set and work history. Not all the skills are listed there because odesk was lacking them in their records to be allowed to add.

We are a group of awesome humans from Waterloo, Ontario who believes the world can be taken over, one line of code at a time. We believe in a world where binary and biology are seamlessly integrated. We'd call ourselves and all our fellow programmers alike the abode of peace between man and machine, if not for the fact that we all contribute the the singularity, which will render us irrelevent to history sometimes this century.

we don't have time to join, we have a physics midterm on saturday and a never-ending history project that haunts us
and I suspect it will break the bonds of our friendships. so that's why we decided to join.

we all have it in our hearts to program something. we've all been this way when we met at the ORPHANAGE in Ankara,
we all studied very hard, putting aside coding, to go to university and just as when we were thinking we'll be having
a good time, we are doomed to do homework and all. 


we are incredibly skillful young fellows.
=======
we're into applications.



---------------------------------------

APPetizers Put You in a Good Mood
================

We are the APPetizers. We build apps, in competitions!   Need we say more?  Probably! (and that's what the section below is for)


Our Dreams
===========================
It's our vision that apps be more than websites - we want to bring about real change with our code.

Our side project is something we believe could change everything political, EasyBallot.org.  We want to bring about political awareness in the US and other democratic countries.  I (Shawn) plan to dedicate all of my winnings to supporting the efforts of EasyBallot.org and help educate voters using their representative's previous voting history.

With time and enough data we can educate the public on gerrymandering, create political blacklists (to highlight the politicians that actually do not reprepresent their voters), and do so much more.

Our team is comprised of developers from National Instruments in Austin, TX.  

Skillz and Amazing Tools
=======
Half of our time at work is spent learning about new tools, and I believe the other half is probably coding.  So while we have a smorgasborg of info and tools in our repertoire, we tend to use what we believe is best for the job.

From our github accounts, we are all fairly well versed in javascript.

I know that with web app development, that's a bit like telling kids that we use snow for our snowmen, but our snowmen can file your taxes, walk the dog, and pick up the kids from daycare.  The rest is just good ideas and some guys having fun coding!

#About me
Hello! I'm **Alfio Missaglia**, a  thirteen years old computer science student who lives in Venice, Italy.
I own the [www.missaglialfio.pw](https://www.missaglialfio.pw/) blog :)

#My project
My project'll be based on the first and the fourth themes.
So, I'll make a creative and interactive lesson platform, with games developed probably in Node.js and jQuery.
I'll also try to learn Python's basics before Hackathon start, I think I can make nice things with it :D

#Skills
I do have experience with those programming languages:
* Java
* PHP
* jQuery
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SQL - [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* HTML5
* Node.js
* Ruby - Using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) webserver
* A **veeeeery** little bit of Python

I also know the basics of Photoshop and GIMP.

#Infos
I think I'll participate in the Hackathon as an individual, but I'm not sure C:
Feel free to send me an email (`public [AT] missaglialfio [DOT] pw`) if you're interested in me.


---------------------------------------

#Team AlgoRhythm
Unfortunately we have been unable to complete our project during the hackathon.

We bagan with a plan to create an educational music game about introductory Computer Science, but quickly decided that we wanted to go in a bit of a different direction.  We finally settled on creating a unique sort of game that through its mechanics would both exemplify and educate the player about an issue we feel strongly about: inclusivity.  It's horrifying how often individuals are excluded from various communities for entirely unrelated traits.  We need to learn to rally together bound by our commonalities, not drive each other away based upon our differences.

Hopefully we will finish this project in the near future, and then have the opportunity to share it with you all.

Amethyst
====

Currently, I'm a student of Electrical Engineering, who's interested in computer programming. I've participated in a number of programming contests before, and 3 or 4 hackathons. In a hackathon held in our school, our team even scored the first. I have almost no experience doing serious web design, but I've spent enough time messing up with sources and APIs I think I *can* do something. 

Talking about the hackathon, living in Iran *and* Tehran, I can't be indifferent about environmental issues. A number of major Iranian lakes and rivers are drying, which result in many problems, including but not limited to damages to agriculture, damages to animal and plant life, decrease in already-rare water resources, dust rising from those dried lakes, which is already becoming a problem, and... To make it all worse, Tehran is already running out of water resources, which means that the tap water might become unsafe to drink. 

Concidering all these, I decided to do a project which would help solve (or reduce the magnitude of) these problems. I'll also learn to work with github, learn more web design, and have a good time participating in a hackathon at 3 AM :)

Here I am:

# Antonio

Hi! I'm an individual developer, excited to participate in the Hackathon.

## About Me

My name is Anton, you can also call me Antonio. I didn't think much about team name, it got to be just my name:).
I'm a PHP developer, also good in JavaScript. For backend I'm using PHP framework called Yii 2. This powerful thing 
leads PHP on completely different level.
And of course I like frontend too, so I got to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially jQuery, an 
awesome JavaScript library.

Looking forward when the koding battle begins... And let the strongest to win!

## Languages and tools I like

-- [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) v2.0 (based on PHP)  
-- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (based on JavaScript)  
-- HTML 5, CSS 3  
-- DBMS: MySQL or [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.org/)  
-- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) (honestly didn't use, but want to try (!) )  

-- and Java (I know it is completely different from PHP, but since I tried it, I really liked it. Although I'm not going 
to use it for the Hackathon, because don't have enough XP for that.)

## About my project

Most of all I want my project to be really useful for people. It is a primary purpose, because if it becomes useful, it is 
always possible to make it awesome.

I've been a developer since learning C at the age of 12. Completly self taught and proficient in full-stack
web development. I've been working as a professional web &amp; software developer for the last 4 years, and now I'm
looking to break into freelance development, before starting my own company. I believe the Hackathon will allow me to
show my skills and prove what I can do, as I will show you a full-stack web application, front-to-back with clean,
tight code, in under 48 hours. I've worked with may bad developers and some good ones along the way, but I feel that I
really shine when I can take the ranes and lead the project from specification to deployment and beyond.

The prizes are great, but I'm more interested in making a name for myself and teaching my 14 year old
son about making HTML 5 games, since he wants to go to college to be a professional game developer and designer, 
once he finishes high school. I love the challege and hope you enjoy the project that I have built.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm a full-stack web developer, well versed in many languages, technologies, frameworks and api's.
I intend to build a complete application using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Javascript, AngularJS, MySQL, 
and all Hackathon sponsered api's, which are applicible to the application I'm going to build.

I don't want to give anything away, so you will have to wait and see....I can say it will be an HTML5 Game that 
introduces software development. :)

This is going to be AWESOME!!!

# The Average Joes
We are a group of highschool friends who are all freshmen at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, this fall.
All four of us took introductory level programming courses this fall, and most of us aren't so experienced in any form of web development.
We see this as a unique challenge that will be very difficult for all of us.

## The Members
 - Luke Barwikowski: I have the most experience out of the group with web languanges, and that's the scary thing. I dabble in webdesign as a hobby, but see a future career in the backend parts of web applications. I will be leading this team, and hopefully I can teach these guys a thing or two and we'll make an awesome project.
 - Lyle Antieau: I admittedly am the worst person in this group. And I suck.
 - Nick Martinelli: I've taken a huge interest in programming lately. I don't really know much about anything, but I'm really excited for this.
 - Joseph Lafayette: Lyle sucks.
 
 ## Our Plan
 We plan on implementing the following frameworks, libraries, and languages
    -HTML5
    -jquery
    -Python
    -Flask
    -backbone.js

# Team Awksome

Combining awkwardness and awesomeness!


---------------------------------------

Axon
====

I am Daniel Masterson, a second year university student at the University of Hull (UK) currently studying MEng Computer Science With Games Development. I have been interested in programming since the age of 9 where I dove straight in (and straight back out again) to C++. My life has lead me through many languages - PHP, JavaScript, UnrealScript and my all time favourite C#. I'm here to show people what I can do with a free weekend and a lot of JavaScript.

Here's my face from that one time what I done did wear a suit to:
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://gravatar.com/avatar/95278064437320be49a4f68d742b9075?size=128' alt='Me'/>

## Why 'Axon'

Because it sounds cool and technical, and my other cool and technical names have been used recently for other things so I kind of had to fall back to this. Also, an axon is a core component of a neuron, so natually it means this project is intelligent, right?

## My Languages

Where to begin...
- C and C++
- C# (And a bit of Java)
- PHP
- JavaScript with JQuery
- UnrealScript (with the Unreal Development Kit)
- Visual Basic if the need arises
- A bunch of other things I've dabbled in like x86 Assembly, Python, Ruby and more esoteric languages. I even made a Befunge interpreter in HTML and JavaScript because...uh.

## What I will be doing in the project

Due to my almost annoyingly deep knowledge into the intricacies and quirks of JavaScript and JQuery, a large quantity of code will be written in that with either a raw HTML or Canvas front end (I once made a 3D Doom-like engine using CSS 3D transforms on div elements, so I'm not limited to going way out of bounds here!). I personally have not use many frameworks or libraries, but I'll definitely investigate whats on offer and see if it will help in my project.

Total babes, right? We joined to learn and demonstrate our skills, and because a global hackathon sounds awesome!

Unfortunately, stress got the better of us and we have chosen not to participate in this hackathon, but instead study for our end-of-term finals. (Operating Systems, Database Management, AND Security Engineering?! Ickk!)

In any case, we wish the best of luck to all other teams! Happy Hacking!

Joke: e^x and constant are walking on a road when they see a differential operator approaching. The constant gets scare and says it will disappear if the differential operator applies on it and runs away. e^x approaches the differentialy operator and says "you have no effect on me, man". The differential operator replies "Hi, I am d/dy"

We are third year students from University of Toronto. Since I just created this profile, we'll be coming back to update it

Individually we are engineers from different disciplines at the University of Toronto. Together we are BitsPlease.

The team is made up on a group of very diverse individuals, and just like the country we are from, CANADA, we believe it is our greatest asset. We have Amelia Ly from Regina who is studying to become a Civil Engineer. Some might say that she is just a small town girl, living in a lonely world, who took the midnight train that landed her right here in Toronto. We also have Paul Deng, an Infrastructure Engineer from Surrey BC. Now if you know anything about the greater Vancouver area, you would know that Surrey is not the best neighbourhood. However, Paul was able to overcome all that and make it all the way here. He believes that every major decision he made in his life has lead up to this moment - the Global Hackathon. Next up, we have Brian Phan. This man is not only a Systems Specialist interning at one of the best hospitals in Toronto, he is also a marathon runner. Legend has it that he once debugged a program while running the Toronto Waterfront Marathon. Another member of the team is Matt Pua. He is a man with brain and bronze. This Electrical Engineer fills his spare time with dragon boating and running obstacle courses that literally end with him jumping through fire. The final member of the team is Benjamin Wang, an Industrial Engineer from Vancouver. In high school he was nominated as most likely to be a used luxury car salesman. However, today he walks a different path and hopes that the Global Hackathon will change his future.

##About your skills and what you are going to do?

Programming is a lifestyle for our two ECE members and a passion for all of us. We are still in the process of learning and discovering new and interesting languages to use, while fine tuning some skills that we learned along our careers.

Pierce Stegman

I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  When I was 7, my dad bought me a book on HTML.  I started coding basic websites, and wanted to do more.  A few years later, my parents bought me Adobe CS4, and I began to make Flash games.  As I made games, I often asked myself how I could make games that helped people.  At first, I began to make educational games.  After a while, I decided I wanted to make things other than education games. As I looked into different things that I could make, I began to learn different languages.  In the process, I learned PHP, JavaScript, C++, C#, and recently HTML5.  I also took an interest in artificial intelligence.  Some examples of projects I made are a cryptocurrency exchange, an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, a system that lets one deploy code via email, and a GUI wallet for cryptonote currencies.

Fox Wilson

Hi, I'm also a junior at TJHSST. I've been playing with web development since I was 8, which led into other languages (I still remember when I wrote BASIC). Today, I'm skilled with Python, Ruby, JS and C. In the seven years between then and now, I've written numerous snippets, tools, and web apps, picked up GNU/Linux, participated in a number of competitions (1st place MITRE STEM CTF 2013, 2014, 3rd place BAH Data Science Bowl, 6th place PicoCTF 2014), went to hackathons (PilotPhilly, PilotDC, MHacks IV, Hack the North 2014), and learned a lot. I'm currently a student systems administrator at TJHSST, where I manage the systems behind our public-facing website, student intranet, and Linux lab. I look forward to (hopefully) participating in and learning from Koding's hackathon.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

Pierce Stegman

I am most skilled with backend development, artificial intelligence, and crytocurrencies.  We have an idea that will make use of AI to make reading the TOS and Terms and Conditions on a website not only fast, but easy and fun.

Fox Wilson

I'm good at backend, data visualization (Chart.JS, gnuplot, others), and systems administration. I'm not that bad at frontend development, and Pierce has already summed up what we'll be doing.


---------------------------------------

About your team
===========================

We have a junior coder and one not junior any more, and one with some experience.The whole team works with JavaScript, and we think we can do amazing things with JavaScript. We never worked all together on the same project, so this is going to be a challenge, but we're looking forward to it. 

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
The team lead is a Node.js developer and Node.js really does great in doing network requests and putting all the stuff together. The rest of the team also has Node.js experience, so we're going to pull in a lot of JavaScript.

The idea is to create a mesh of the existing public APIs and gather publicly available data and create a useful dashboard for displaying and manipulating this data. We want to pull in as much data as we can and then show it in an interesting way

#About Our Project
We know that in the world there are many problems to be solved, just as there are many people interested in helping others in need, they usually do not know how so we want to create an application that will help you create social conscience bearing to know the problems facing our planet travez of a web platform that uses a map showing countries of the world and according to the subject selections red most problematic countries; Once you've learned the situations of each country or city you can help an initiative in the city you prefer you through a financial donation or being part of a team of volunteers.

We believe that supporting our knowledge in this area will help our planet but especially to bring this project to reality begin to combat problems such as extreme poverty, as Guatemalans know very well but little is being done to eradicate it.
That's why we ask you to become a hero allowing to actually carry this platform is part of WORLD OF HEROES!!.

About CleverCrypter
===========================

| Jack Atkinson

Hello, my name is Jack Atkinson! I'm an Australian citizen born July, 1996 who moved to America in 2005 which
is where I currently reside. Since I first gained the ability to turn on my mothers computer I have had an avid
interest in how they work. My curiosity was not getting me into too much trouble until I had a failed attempt at
dual booting her computer with Ubuntu. The end result of that endeavor led to her computer being sent back
to HP for the first time. That interest has manifested itself into a love for programming and solving problems
with computers. After delving deeper and deeper into the land of software development I had heard about hackathons
but thought they were a little bit above my level. When I read about Koding's Virtual Hackathon that was mostly
aimed towards High School students, I thought I should give it a shot and to my astonishment and excitement I was
accepted! One fact that made this competition stick out to me was that I didn't need to travel anywhere which made
it easily accessible as I am in my senior year at high school.

Skills
========
Currently my strongest skills are: C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, DOS(Batch Files)

For this project I plan on expanding my skillset of Javascript.


The Plan
========
I have chosen the theme of Introducing software development to a beginner. To make my idea a reality I will be
using the following API's:

Even though technology has evolved so much in the last 15 years, there are many solutions for problems we face everyday that date decades ago.
Problems that we are "just used to" or that "we can't help but do what everybody else is doing". 
It's time to change that!

We aim for the unthought. We want to redesign solutions for **language learning**.

I'm a front-end developer who is excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that a lot of people can use every day. I'm passionate about my craft.

I added my picture because I have cool glasses. B-)

## My Passion 

One thing that I'm most passionate about is changing the way we provide education today.
I'm currently making two projects that are related to changing the education. 
And I hope that on this hackathon I will make the third one.

### My Toolbox

On this hackathon I will be using HTML/CSS/SASS + MEAN stack (mongo, express, angular, node)...
I will try to integrate my app with some API and social sites. 
Technology today provides as with cool real time based communication so my solution for this hackathon will 
be solution will be in realtime between users. hint -> Socket.IO

Forever unsatisfied with the state of Dev-tools, finally ran out of excuses not to try my own..

Team Crystallized

Pascal -> very briefly Java -> Python -> C++ -> Javascript.

Looking forward to giving something back to the community.

What?
=======
Fell in a love-hate relationship with Javascript 2 years ago. 

This weekend, we are gonna have the talk - can we make it work long term? Or are the scars from her past just too deep? 
It will be Famo.us!

*In case it goes well, maybe will bring in a designer friend to polish things up a bit

#Welcome to DIVISION
Imagination and Creativity can change the World!

##About me
I'm Philip Rego Morato, 18 years old, from Davao City, Philippines. I'm just a newbie and I want to learn more by participating in this Global Hackathon. I know that the chance of me winning this competition is very low, but still I am determined to code with my best.

I took computer classes during my High School years. Through edX, I was able to study Computer Science 50, an online course by Harvard. Now I'm able to program with C and the basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have no plans yet but I will make sure that I will have before the Hackathon starts.

I am a final year Software Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

If I am not coding, I am either climbing things (rocks, trees ...) or trying to get discovered by a bear in a forest. Or finding a roof in town that is cool enough to hang out on. Also, generally trying new things.

Why I decided to join?
=======
As a student with finals this week, I decided to join a hackathon for the fun of it. And trust me, they are super fun. Ah, I feel the adrenaline already!!

Between CO-OPs and part-time jobs, I have around 2.5 years of software experience. Along with an engineering degree, I don't find time for extracurricular projects. That's why I am joining this hackathon. I once joined a hackathon by Facebook and it was the BEST thing ever. After that, I started treating all my assignments as hackathons. Pfff of course I don't leave them till the last minute just so I am  can pull an all-nighter and get it all working with extra features just for fun. No! ... Yes, yes I do. It feels so AWESOME to create something spectacular in a heck of a sleepless night.

About my skills
=======
I worked on back-end, front-end and everything in between. So far, I worked on 6 different projects and each used different technologies and were in varying fields (networking, cloud/OpenStack, vision processing, web development (check out OrbitHub.com), medical applications, ...)

Some of the languages I know: C, C++, HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, Perl, Java and others

What I am going to do?
=======
The project will be related to distributed systems algorithms.

Currently there are so many distributed algorithms out there with tedious pseudo code and big blocks of text that lose meaning. So I'll be developing a program to help visualize these algorithms. This will cover theme 2 of the hackathon.

The web app can be later expanded to add more algorithms.

Will be coding in Java.

=====

Hi, I am Prashanth. I am a free thinker :D
you too are free to think ofcourse!
I keep reminding myself that freedom is all we need. I try to break free of all things that bind me. Things like jobs.

I would like to create that which is necessary for freedom, just for the love of it.

Ok, enough philosophy. I am a test and automation engineer, was a freelance programmer coding in scientific computing
till about half a year ago, I am a Python programmer and I am in love with everything that is open source *Github rocks*.

Why did I decide to join Koding Global Hackathon?
Lately I have been ideating a lot. Now I have a whole bunch of ideas, unimplemented, untested. So I see this hackathon as
a nice opportunity to make something fun.

About my skills and what I am going to do?
====

I can pretty much handle python. So I would like to use Flask and polymer.js to make a simple app.

What is this app about?
Patience my friend. All I can tell you now is, its got to do with unlocking myself and the world along with me :D

All the best! and thanks for wishing me luck ;)

I began doing freelance web development in high school, and had become disenchanted with it by the time I reached
University.  However, after working some co-op positions with some passionate web developers, I gained a appreciation
and insight for what the web is capable of.

Now, I'm all about pushing the limits of what the web can do.  I like to think I have some creative and innovative
ideas to bring to the table, and I'm excited to be taking part in the first ever Global Hackathon.  One day, when events
like this are commonplace, I'll be able to look back and say that I was there for the beginning!


Skills and Direction
=======

My passion has always been in interactive media, anything that takes entertainment beyond something to be simply
consumed, allowing people to influence and engage with it.  I love experimenting with new web technologies to
break expectations regarding the limitations of the web.  My hope is to combine my passion with these
technologies in a result that is both practical and delightful for users.

Fluffle
================

Welcome to the Fluffle team page  :)


Team Fluffle (single person)
============================

Hello, my name is Kris and I'm a software engineer from Minneapolis, MN. 
Most of the work I've done in "the Industry"  has been data related ... 
data warehousing big data. Though I've worked in a variety of programming
languages, and have a deep understanding of data, I've rarely had the
opportunity to really explore front-end work and develop something really
slick that just begs to be used, clicked, played with.

(As a side note: ) "Fluffle" is what we called a pudgy little aging yorkie 
named Sunny we adopted from my mother in law years ago. It's my fondest 
wish that he's curled up in a soft blanket, snoring softly, 
weiner to the wind in the coziest of all contentment. I miss him, lots.


Skills
=======
Data: Databases (Oracle, Informix, MySql), ETL: Ab Initio 

Programming: PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, C, C++

Plan
====
I've picked my challenge! I am going to tackle challenge 3 and endeavour 
to make navigating site legalese (Terms of Service/Use, etc. less 
dreadfully boring)!

Tools I'l Use
=============
Node, Express, Jade, Mongodb, Phaser 2.0, assets from OpenGameArt.com






---------------------------------------

##About Me

I'm a high school student from Macedonian. I like developing video games.

I'm still not sure what APIs I will be using. But most likely I will use Node.JS and maybe use PubNub API.

About your team
===========================

| Shamir Raza (Futago-za Ryuu) 
|-------------
| Can't find an image of my self, will upload one later and place it.

I've been programming for 8 years now, but only started seriously in the last 4 years,
and most of that time has been devoted to creating random Node.js projects, hacking away at them,
then dumping them! Dont get me wrong, its just after I've achieved a sense of satisfaction
from what I've done so far, my interest wanes so I move on. The only 2 consistant thing have
been trying to create my own programming language and creating a cross-platform/language
game using it.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
So far I've decided I'll be making a Three.js based game, still have to decide the rest.

We are self-taught developers that love to learn new things, especially things that matter in a social context. Our main goal has been to contribute to change the way we treat education in our culture. We share some feelings about formal education and how it should encourage students to care about the society when learning a profession instead to just getting certification. Innovation is something that needs to cover the way we relate to others.

Ivan
====
Front-end and back-end developer, started his journey into the software development at High School trying a little tricks with html and css by himself. Finished the underdegree in Control and Automation Engineering at IFG Brazil on august 2014. His projects in the college included developing a simple protocol in Python to comunicate traffic control devices and a web interface for users to see data. Recently started to delve into Rails, CSS and Javascript development.

Henrique
========
A passionate software engineer. Started his journey in development late (compared to others) when started his Computer Engineering course at UFG. Later he discovered he really loved that, so he decided to move to a Software Engineering at UFG to focus efforts on software development. Now still coursing, he is focusing his efforts on learning Agile Methodologies, TDD, BDD, Rails, Ruby, metaprogramming and everything related. Wants to make software that matters.

Although we are still in highschool, we have experience in programming and developing in many languages and platforms.
This is our first time at event like this, but we are ready and hopefully we can participate.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We aim to build an utility that's going to be useful to millions of people every day, it could be used to warn from upcoming danger and even save people's lives.

We are the Geeky254 Team, so we are participating in Koding from Nairobi. We are quiet but our minds
are forever at work.

Joel Okomoli & Felista Moraa 

About your team
===========================

Joel is a social entrepreneur who would invest in Agricultural enterprises that aim to increase food production while conserving the environment or Green Energy Companies that seek to enhance the use of renewable energy across the continent to meet the persistent shortage of power in Africa. I would also seek to invest in the under-utilized high rainfall zones (small holder farmers) or in the semi-arid regions with potential for irrigation. Horticulture and growing non-staple foods that are highly nutritious such as fruits and vegetables would be my area of interest. This is to ensure sustainable research and improved quality of yields. This can be realized by employing emerging mobile technologies.

Felista is a system administrator with a passion for programming, system analysis and design. She works in Nairobi and participates in the development of ICT in Africa. 

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join? 

We decided to join because we love challenges and always look for opportunity to improve our skills in software development. 

We would like to inspire our students with the right skills and urge them towards problem solving within the environment we live in. A lot of situations could be improved with the right tools and technologies but these are a long time coming due to lack of innovation.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Joel:
I have excellent IT skills and experience of working with adult learners using MS Outlook, Word and Excel, php, ASP.Net and SQL. I have also taught business statistics to Accounting students. Previously I have worked as head of department (IT) at Oshwal College Parklands and Century College Machakos charged with implementation of IT projects, training, monitoring and evaluation, user support, programming, database design and implementation as well as data management. I have skills in IT audit procedures, risk analysis, hardware maintenance and network configuration in Windows/Unix environments. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Computer Science (Moi University) and I am writing my final project for a Master of Science Degree in Information Systems at the University of Nairobi.

What we wold like to do as a team is to develop an android native application that will improve farmers' access to market information and motivate their savings culture by posting weekly updates amongst peer organiations. This will keep the savings on an upward trajectory.

Felista:
Coming soon

Hi my name is Roger and I decided to join because I felt like it would be a fun experience to participate in the first ever virtual hackathon. I am personally inspired by the way the internet has revolutionized and inspired the act of a worldwide collaboration between hackers who collectively work together in open source software projects. 

I believe the internet is a tool that enables for the best possible software to be produced because it provides an open channel for the best minds to communicate and share ideas. In the same way that the internet inspires collaboration, I am fascinated to participate in this virtual hackathon to see if the internet will inspire competition in a similar manner. Are we about to witness an epic battle between the smartest and most creative hackers in the world? I am excited to find out.       


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I am primarily a Go developer. (the team name being a pun where you run a goroutine on a for loop that calls a function broke; invalid syntax perhaps but "go func(){for{broke();}}" was a bit unwieldy)

I like to poke my head around exotic low level software like research operating system kernels (plan9, inferno, etc) and new language compilers/runtimes. (go, rust, etc).

The project I am going to be working on is a competitive multiplayer game that  
helps teach Programming with an insight towards key principles like resource optimization and the design of powerful artifical intelligence algorithms.

Gothic Elephant
================

Our team consisting of two developers and one designer that works together for a long time.

This is not our first joint project, but our first participation in the Hackathon.
 

**Staff:**

**Nickolay Kopylov**

PHP-developer,

Closed Stock Company "Mamba"

**Olimzhon Iuldashov**

Mobile developer. According to the hackathon rules (mobile apps are not allowed) he will be web-developer (both client-side and server-side)

Unofficial employee of Science Institute of Higher Nervous Activity

**Danila Alpatov**

UI/UX designer, client-side developer.

Ekoprom Business Group


Project
================

During the hackathon we intend to develop a project focused on handling such a global problem as psychiatric illnesses.

**Why mental disorders make a global challenge?**

Statistically as many as 20-25% global population suffer this or that mental disease.

Meanwhile this statistics ignores the influence of psychiatric disorders of the sick on their families. It does not take into account the effect on the global economy either (covering expenses for hospital admissions, unemployment, disability allowances, unplanned vacations, etc.). But the latter turns this problem into the most  important one for the mankind.

**Which goals does our project pursue?**

We set two mutually important aims:

**1)**	To collect the information on the illnesses dynamics and various factors influence for further studies and treatment adjustment.

**2)**	To ease as much as possible patients’ sufferings by raising control over the disorder.

**How can our project tackle the problem?**

We are going to develop a system for collecting information about patients’ condition and forwarding the data gathered to doctors, psychologists, therapists, self-aid groups and researchers. 

**Why has our team picked up this topic and why are we confident in our project success?**

The idea for our project was born by our team member Olymzhon Iuldashov who personally had gone through alarm, panic attacks, depersonalization, derealization, depression, psychosis, euphoria, delusion, paraphrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Having but a very close experience of a close friend’s disease our team is aware of how important IT decisions are for mental patients and we know the way to deal with this global challenge


**[Check it now!](http://kapidarium.com/)**

How did we hacked during the hackathon?
-----------

First at all we choosed a place where we were able to work together. This place for us was Danila's flat, where we had spent all 48 hours of Hackathon.

Then we did some preparation before the Hackathon start - install web-server, create GitHub repo and some planning work.

So, we used Trello to store our tasks and plans, shared our code between team members with GitHub and off course we had used the real-time communication.

The result of this 48-hours hacking session is here: [http://kapidarium.com/](http://kapidarium.com)

**Tools that we had used in our project:**

1. **Yii2** for backend (API).
2. **backbone.js** and some dirty hacks with **jQuery** ;) on frontend.
3. **composer** for PHP packages
4. **Nginx** web server
5. **php-fpm**
6. **MySQL**
7. **phing** to build our application on server
8. **Redis** 
9. Amazing **Koding VM** as production server.

Hello, we are a team mostly from Japan (Tokyo). However, our team is actually very international, consisting of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and Japanese! Our team name is called Gundam because we like ガンダム！Gundam/ガンダム is a Japanese giant robot mecha anime series and is very popular. Gundam represents our courage and our love of technology!

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.rapidfiregames.com/sites/default/files/pics/gundammemories/mobile-suit-gundam.jpg"/>
</p>

Although there is an explosion in the popularity of computer science in the United States and other countries, computer science and engineering is still looked down upon in Japan. Engineers are looked down upon in Japan, and being and engineer is not a popular job in Japan. We want to change this mindset and situation. Technology and engineering is making the world a better place, and Japanese engineers should contribute to that. If we win, we want to use this opportunity and make it so that all Japanese people will realize the power and potential of coding, computer science, and hackathons!

Jumpei
=======
Jumpei Yamane is an accomplished and experienced manager of various hackathons in Japan, and is a prominent advocate/technology evangelist. He currently works at Givery Inc., and is also the Japanese ambassador for AngelHack, a premier developer relations platform, and is an organization that hosts massive Hackathons around the world. He aims to make hackathons popular in Japan and to make Tokyo the next hub for startup companies. He will be the UI/UX designer and co-director of this team. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jumpeiyamane)

Takuya
=======
Takuya is a skilled full stack web engineer who knows Java, Python, Ruby, and Scala. He will be working as the main developer of the team because of his strength in web engineering, and the fact that he knows lots of web technologies. He also knows some iOS and Android. He is very experienced. His profile picture is cute. [Website](https://www.facebook.com/takuya.miyamoto.9083)

Cherry
=======
Cherry is an engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and has a lot of Android and Java experience. She is passionate about Android development, technology, and internet of things. She is currently interning at Microsoft and wants to learn more web development from this hackathon. She will be one of the engineers of this team. She also really likes Gundam. [Website](http://cherryzhang.net)

Tommy
=======
Tommy just recently started app development and web development, and he has fallen in love with it. He used to be a mechatronics engineer at the University of Waterloo, but recently switched to computer engineering so that he can get both a hardware, but more software engineering experience (he loves coding). He has definitely learned a lot of languages very quickly in frosh year, including python, iOS development, html, css, and JavaScript. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tommyjungis)

Nam
=======
Nam is the most recent member of our team, and has years of experience in Android and Java development, and came to Japan and is permanently working here developing Android applications. He frequently goes to the Tokyo Android Group, and is an avid fan of the mobile OS. He also has some web development experience as well, and can't wait to try and learn more about web development in this hackathon. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/butchigo)

About Our Project
=======
Many people want to help out others in need, but usually they don't. We wanted to create an application that will help give an incentive and more motivation to be more charitable. In order to do this, we created Donathon, a social web application where a user can be either an individual or a whole team of people who try to fundraise and donate money to natural disasters around the world. There is an interactive data map on our site where you can see real time natural disasters happening, and you can click on them and donate to them.

This service is meant to also give "tokens of appreciation" of users/teams that contribute and help the most! You can get points if you donate to these disasters, and users/teams with most points can get token of appreciation from us.

We are planning to give users virtual badges to share our appreciation to them, like how StackOverflow has those badges. We also plan to give top users great real life opportunities, such as being able to travel and volunteer at the place they donated in real life, or we can give them more materials/goods to help support their fundraising/donations.

Updates on Our Project
=======
1 hour in: We had to change locations to a place where we can all sleep over for two days. We are an hour late to the hackathon, and we have not programmed yet, but this is getting us pumped up!
24 hours in: Some of us slept for some time, and Jumpei-san had to go to another hackathon, but can still help us online. We are making some progress, but it is definitely a good learning experience! Two of us are learning lots about web development, as we never did it before.

We are three friends, **Edoardo Odorico (edoardoo)**,  **Lorenzo Farnararo (baldarn)**  and **Sanjeya Cooray (Sanje)** from Florence, Italy. We all studied engineer. While we were studying Edo and Lorenzo joined our University Open Source Software Lab, LILiK, where they developed their coding and unix skills, and some free software philosophy. 
Together with other **LILiK** members they began to meet together at Edoardoo's house, in hacking sessions during the weekends. This is where they thought at first one of their success projects: turning lights on and off with an arduino, a raspberry, a pinch of javascript and a lot of hacking nights (usually with some wine, don't forget we're italian). Since we wanted to share our hard and funny work with the rest of the world, we've built a blog/tutorial about our hacking projects, hack.lenotta.com. We mainly hack on arduino, raspberry, antennas, HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. 
Lorenzo met Sanje while working together in a software house and we all knew from the very beginning he was the right full stack developer we were missing.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We're skilled on both frontend and backend development. We'll probably use baaskets of javacript (perhaps for the server side too, why not?) and we would like to bleach the mess of EULA and TOS around, compress it, colour it and... you'll see (me heheheh)...
Update (1/12/2014): maybe some changes in plans? maybe some multimedia stuff? Something is boiling under the plate...

## Introducing The Hackateers

We are a group of three hackers hailing from [Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar](http://qatar.cmu.edu).
Two of us are graduates and one is currently a student.
Our members have previously participated in hackathons and even helped organize, mentor, or judge a hackathon or two.
We decided to join this hackathon to combine the different skills and experiences we gathered throughout the different paths we have embarked on to hack on something of great.


## About the team

  - **Ossama Obeid:** I am a research associate working in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have previously co-founded a company working on iOS apps for local clients. My interests include hacking software and hardware, painting, and reading up on Physics, Psychology, and History. Aiming to be a Renaissance man :)

  - **Afnan Fahim:** Hacker for all things front-end and aspiring new media artist. Side hobbies include learning languages. I envision a day when I will be able to travel to any country and communicate kinda sorta effectively.

  - **Mahmoud Alismail:** I am a CS junior at CMU. I enjoy working on computer vision applications and backend development. I like to use Django, Node, and OpenCV on my backends. In my free time, I tend to hack RGB+D cameras as well as highly scalable web applications.


## What are we doing?
Our idea is not solid yet but we will be writing a web app using Python for our back-end and HTML, JS, and CSS for our front-end.
We will be possibly utilizing NLP technologies and APIs such as NLTK, wit.ai, or IBM Watson.

We are small mobile team working mostly with:

- Ruby
- JavaScript (including Coffee)
- Rails, Sinatra, Padrino
- Slim, Haml, Jade
- Backbone, Angular JS, ExtJS, jQuery

We'll develop a real-time application useful for many groups of people.
This application will contain a reach front-end and some WebSocket features.
Other details are classified now :)

Team Hatzors!
=============

We are three grade 10 students in Canada, looking to see what we can do here. Together we are quite fluent in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`, `Python`, and are learning `Swift` and dabbling in lots of other languages. We've got about 15 years of code experience between the three of us.

We are:

### Eden S.-G.

<div style="float:right"><img src="http://edensg.me/files/images/blueglitch.gif" style="width:300px" /></div>
I mainly work on front-ends, usually in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`. I also dabble in Blender, Inkscape and GIMP for design work. I put some of my web work [here](http://edensg.me/), and I have a bunch of design/visuals [here](http://edensg.me/files.html#files%2Fimagesl) and [here](https://edensg.github.io/#page-nav-CGI) (haven’t updated this last page in a while). I’ve been exploring Jekyll and `SASS`, and have been using tools like Node.JS and `Ruby` for a while now.

I was introduced to coding in grade four by an awesome teacher I had — he had a bunch of Commodore 64s in the classroom and taught the entire class the basics of `BASIC`. I ended up making text-based adventures, lottery/probability games, and even a conversation engine (it didn’t say much, but it did work). The next year I made a full game of Asteroids in Scratch, complete with X, Y and rotational momentum and acceleration, and asteroid splitting. I since have taught myself `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS` through Codecademy, and have started making an online version of [Vector 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115042508/http://playthisthing.com/vector-3) with Three.JS. I have contributed code for Fight For the Future, have made interactive online infographics for school projects, and have attended a local hackathon for Global Hack Day where I set up a Pi to run as a transparent Tor proxy.

I have been taught Java 8 and Python 3 at school, but have pursued many other languages on my own time, including `C`, `C++`, `Objective-C`, and `Swift`, plus a few scripting languages, such as `Bash`, `Perl`, and `Ruby`. I got into scripting because I wanted to automate things that I did repeatedly, and that opened up doors to learning higher-level languages, rather than just scripting.

I am also very interested in Bitcoin. I have been mining Bitcoin since May of this year, and I’ve made about 0.4 BTC (about 168 CAD as of the time of writing). I think that cryptocurrencies will be used a lot in the future — Cryptocurrencies cannot be controlled by any central agency, so the value of the currency cannot be manipulated by the government to fit their own needs. Also, since they can easily be sent to anyone in the world no matter where they are, there would no longer be a need for currency exchange fees/inconvenience of exchanging currencies.

I have also been running a Tor relay, an I2P node, and a Freenet node (with 50GB of cache), contributing to three of the leading networks that protect privacy and anonymity online.

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. 

I'm Taj, and I have had the illusion of consciousness for 15 years.

I code regularly, mostly in `Python`. I like object-based stuff.
Right now I am working on the soft/firmware of a wrist thingy/smartwatch with a Raspberry Pi. Some recent projects include an Arduino-controlled laser-prompted light switch, programmed, of course, with the Arduino IDE, and a food distribution simulator written in `Python` that has an AI that decides what to spend resources on.
Some dabbling has also been done into `HTML`, `Javascript`, and `BASIC` (where I started, in grade 5, with Eden).
Most of this has been self taught through the powers of the internet, with no school input.
I like to do things as simply and as straightforward as possible, favoring understandability over fanciness, and if anything gets too complex or nested, I tend to start over from a previous patch.
I also really like my hat.

## The plan...
*{insert maniacal evil laughter}*

We plan on recreating a three-dimensional space board game with ThreeJS and HTML5 Canvas for the browser. The game is based on strategy — there are many things to keep track of — and there are spaceships. Come on, who doesn't like spaceships? *Pew! Pew!* ***Kablooie!***

The game is turn-based, and involves acceleration, momentum and maybe even orientation in 3D space (or even 4D, if we get around to it). As you play the game, you will learn about calculating distances in multi-dimensional space, probability, falloff, and preemptive action.

### What we've got so far:

# Team Hekkie
We are Business & IT students at the University of Twente (NL) and colleages at Cofano Software Solutions with a passion for awesome stuff creation.

Our team name is inspired by a (Dutch) video-fragment ([view on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU83bmwMiYU)). It's about an employee of a company calling the the pound-sign on your phone "Hekkie" (which sound the same as the English term "Hacky"). This caused some confusion with the interviewed man, since "Hekkie" also means fence which he doesn't have, because he lives in a tower block.

| <img width="100" height="100" src='https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/169093' alt='Matt Huggins'/> |

I've only been a part of one 3-hour hackathon in the past, and I'd like to start
participating in more.  I have a long history of work, but I'd like to have a
personal portfolio of work outside of the jobs I've held.  I also enjoy coding
in my spare time, so participating in hackathons just makes sense! :)


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

I grew up coding games in my spare time and went to college for the same.
However, I switched gears in college after taking a web development course, and
that's what I've been doing ever since (with some mobile projects in the mix
too).

For this project, I'll probably try to mix the two, creating a web-based game.
I'm not 100% sure if this is what I'm going to actually do, but it's a pretty
good bet!

# Team In-Toke-A-Bola

Though I'm a team of one, I'm passionate about software development, engineering and just building fun and interesting tools and products.

# About the team
| Eric |
|--
| <img width="100" height="100" src='eric.jpg' alt='Photo of Eric'/> |

# Motivation
I've joined this hackathon because I'm trying to bootstrap 2 companies in my time outside of my normal (full-time) day to day job.  Winning this competition could help me fund operational costs of these companies and build my own software company.  I'm passionate about my projects and I'd like to retire at 40.  Then I can enjoy the outdoors more often here in Colorado and focus on supporting various public-serving organizations by building tools and software for them.  Some of those organizations are: [CAIC](http://avalanche.state.co.us/about-us/),   [The Access Fund](http://www.accessfund.org/), [Friends of Berthoud Pass](http://berthoudpass.org/#sthash.FK69QPZG.dpbs), [Friends of Indian Creek](https://friendsofindiancreek.wordpress.com/mission/), ...

# Skills / Concept
I'm skilled in development using a number of different technologies: Java, Ruby on Rails, Angular JS, etc.,  to name a few.

I've seen a number of different HTML5 / Angular Games out there, and that might be what I go for.  I do live in Colorado, so building an app for the Medical Marijuana Industry is not off the table.


---------------------------------------

<img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/KbwBKnH.png' alt='Incorgito'/>

Incorgito is composed of Mark Steve Samson and Beato Bongco from the Philippines. We took one look at the hackthon themes and decided to join. You had us at educational HTML5 games.

We work at [Insync](https://insynchq.com) doing web development, but the only reason we really even dipped our toes into the world of programming was to try and make games. As with many things in life, you often end up doing something else entirely than what you set out to do. As time passed, the world of application and web development consumed us. But the urge to develop a game has always burned at the back of our minds and will probably never leave us. When we read the topic list on koding.com, we immediately saw the opportunity to combine two things we love: making games and teaching others how to program.

We want to win this hackathon because it will validate our that voice at the back of our heads. We want to win because we believe programming is an essential skill in the world today, and we want to be the ones that help spread the fire.

We are Incorgito. Expect us.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

Jason Hughes (VonMises) is a father of three.  He and his wife homeschool their children.  He worked his way through college working in technical support for a software company that services the hotel industry.  After graduation he transitioned into development, bringing his coworkers (autt and jbeard88) with him.  VonMises is interested in working collaboratively on a project inside a defined window of time.  Even though they work together, they rarely get to be involved with the entire design and devlopment process in a collaborative way.

Our second team mate is Brandon McCartney (autt).  More info to come.

Rounding out the trio is Jeffery Beard (jbeard88).  More info to come.

Team Invincibles

================

About our team

===========================
We are a group of programming enthusiasts very motivated to solve real world problems. All of us 
are students enrolled in colleges in the United States. We decided to join this competition 
because of our passion for programming and finding solutions for complex problems. We have prior
experience with developing applications making use of real time data to solve everyday problems.
Our biggest motivation behind us taking part in this competition is to get a really good 
feel of some of the API's mentioned in the document. We do not have much experience working with
these API's and would relish the opportunity to build something cool by utilizing them

Skills and Project Idea

J-Unit
================

We are Ali and Bobby, a strong developer / designer team. Ali is located in Lahore,
Pakistan, while Bobby is in Boston, U.S.

We met during work a few months ago. Due to our complimentary skills and good work chemistry,
we decided we'd be the dream team for going into this hackathon together.

About us
===========================
Our team has a yin/yang philosophy. Bobby, the yin, does all the design, CSS,
and UX work. Ali, the yang, does the backend programming to bring everything together.
This works great, as we have skills that compliment each others' weaknesses.

Our name, 'J-Unit', comes from our mutual love of hip hop and unit testing,
mixed with the fact that we use Java as our main programming language, for both client and server side.

Our biggest motivation for participating in this hackathon, is so we can have a shot at an interview
with some of the awesome VCs who are on the judges' panel. Our dream is to do a startup,
and we have an awesome idea that we'd love to pitch.

# Joof

Awesome team having a damn royal experience in hardware, software, anywhere.

We have skills to design, to code and to make anything looks pretty good.

### Skills

Have you seen a combination of Raspberry Pi, Arduino and lathe? We did it! Have you seen a backend for it? Oh, it's interesting. May be mobile app for it? Or just remote controled robot?

So, we develop backend systems, frontend and mobile apps. It seems to be a full-stack.

### Hi, I'm Yong-uk.

I'm a developer who barely write code these days cause I have no
interest in anything but [*LOVELIVE*](http://www.lovelive-anime.jp)

I have experience in C++(especially in WebKit), Obj-C, JavaScript,
Python, etc... Nothing's been left in my brain, though. But it's
okay. Google is always with me.

I'm a web developer with over seven years of professional experience, through which time I worked with various web technologies.
I believe web is great tool that can be used to enhance our lives. 
Because of all the development difficulties people are being less creative and less efficient when pushing the envelope of web possibilities.

My plan is to create one of educational prototypes for this first global hackathon, primarily using JavaScript.

Dear Judges,

I am 17 years old and have only been coding for about a year. I know some HTML/CSS/JS and that is all. I though a hackathon would be cool with my friend. He did not have time to do it with me because of finals, and I admit I have no idea how to use Koding on my own. So here is my idea, although it is not built yet. I hope I can truly participate in your hackathon next year.

Sincerely,

Isaac Rowe

My name is Mona. I've worked as a software developer using C# and .Net framework. I chose to learn python and RoR to develop open source programs.

It's my first time joining a hackathon. I decided to participate as I need a purpose to develop applications. I need to make sure that my work is really helping other people. It is also a good chance to practice the new tools which I've been learning.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I plan to use a python related web development framework, javascript, html5 and CSS. I'm mostly attracted to themes of games: introducing software development and HTML5 games.

##Mike Rickert
####Lead Developer, websocket guru, commit junkie

<img src=http://i.imgur.com/PxIZfkv.jpg></img>

"I've had a love for computers for as far back as I can remember. Back then it was atari and pentiums but by learning to get systems like those to run the latest games I was inspired to tinker and code. Since that time I've worked over half a decade in the IT world, mostly on the sysadmin and computer networking side of things. Over the last year though I've fallen in love with coding all over again and have been spending many a late night hour cramming myself with every bit of coding knowledge I can. Ruby and Rails will always be my first love as thats where I rediscovered my love to code, but since then I've expanded my view to javascript, ember, and other frameworks. I code because it's my passion, not because its a job, and I love every day of it."

My Story
==============
My name is Loqman Hakimi. I'm software and web developer from Iran.

My Skills
=====
I love coding in Ruby and using Rails to develop web applications.
and also like coding in javascript and using Node.js and Socket.io for realtime web
applications.

For front-end development Bootstrap and Font-Awesome are my choices.

As the theme of this hacketon is problems faceing the earth, and as I recently watched on the "Last Week Tonighy with John Oliver"'s episode about global warming and some people still don't believe in it, I would like to create an app to visualize this fact.

I am just a developer trying to make a difference. I quit college in the last year to study what I want to study.
The picture you see is me when I was 19 after serving the army here in Brazil. Why did I serve? Just for the sake of it.
I wanted to loose some weight and get paid to do so, at least, that was how I was looking at it. 
Turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life and I am fucking proud of it.

I was born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, my parents managed to move out from Rio to Curitiba, where I currently live in.
Here I managed to get a great education, entered one of the best public schools and got a 100% schollarship from the government and started studying Computer Science at the Catholic University.

I am proud of my achievements but, as I you can see, I am facing this single handed. Why? Because I can't find people that are commited as I am.

I have great friends, don't get me wrong, but none of them is into programming. So, it's just me again facing challenges. 
Hahaha


My Stack
=======
- PHP using Laravel
- Javascript (jQuery, AngularJS)
- PostgresSQL
- Phonegap (maybe)

[Source](http://github.com/lalkmim/race-coding)

Unfortunatelly couldn't finish it on time, the project was a racing game where people could give their first steps on the programming.

The race engine is almost complete, the JS interpreter needed little work (using PEG.js) and the web interface needed a LOT of work.

I've been developing web applications for nearly two decades now, and joined into this Hackathon as a means to focus on one of several projects I've been toying around with.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm a long-time PHP developer, and as the technology has been shifting more client-side, getting more and more emphasis on Javascript in addition to HTML5 and CSS skills.

For this Hackathon, I'll be working on a project pursuing theme number 4 (HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented); I have a game I created years ago in PHP, that I'll be updating to use HTML5 advancements to make it much more interactive. I'll be utilizing the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) Javascript/[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) stack, and possibly adding in the PubNub service for game interaction notifications that need to be faster than Meteor's default two-way binding updates allow.

We are part of a young start-up, and we joined this hackathon to challenge ourselves and try to get new ideas and renew our determination to keep going forward.

About skills and project
========================
The goal of our project is to show the correlation between good analogies and the mastering of programming skills via simple games. This corresponds to the second theme.
To be fair, we can work with many languages and frameworks. But, for this particular project, we may use these:
	- C || Lua || Php
	- HTML and JS

Hi, i'm **Pulpo**, and i am proud to present my solo team 'Octomouse'. 
Octomouse comes from octopus (me) and mouses because two friends _(Pinky and The Brain)_ were going to join me, but they were too busy trying to conquer the world so they couldn't actually join.

**It is my very first time in a hackathon!** I am very exited about the experience!

Follow my team on twitter! I'm posting updates every now and then! https://twitter.com/phk_nevermore

My name is Germán, I'm 25 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am coding since i was 14. 8 years doing that professionally.
My favorite things in the computer world are coding, hacking arround with Linux machines, and gaming to relax my mind.
I joined this hackaton because i love challenges and i want to do something fun an exciting.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

In my history as a software developer, i jumped across many jobs, different languages, technologies, frameworks and methodology.
My strongs are PHP, Java, Linux, and rubber duck debugging. I suck at front-end, REALLY. I don't have the patience to reload a page four hundred times to get it to look as i like.

The voice that reads very fast legal disclamers in Argentinian radio ads has inspired me to make a fine print fast-reader.
Since i've been left alone, i don't expect to get something big, but anyway i'm gonna have a fun time coding.
I don't care if i dont win, in fact, i'm sure my solution will be unfinished and totally unpolished by the end of the hackathon. 
I just hope I can share a cool idea with the world, and make somethig useful from this.

_Thanks for reading, and good luck to all the teams!_

Our team is completely virtual and remote. I met Rodion on Twitter few days ago and have never seen him before. He is great and I love to read his code, that's why we hack together at *OrangeVerse*.

'OrangeVerse' is the random name created using [Koding Global Hackathon Team Name Generator](https://vast-cove-6783.herokuapp.com/), which I created a few days before to give the name for our team. :-)

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *build great thing* during the hackathon and *show what the random can do*. Taleb's Black Swan. In Random We Trust.

Sincerely yours,
Vladimir and Rodion. :p

<img width="100" height="100" src='http://nancyja.in/images/me.png' alt='Nancy'/>

I am the single human in this team with a set of Pastels. I’ve not been doing anything great all my life but sketching and scribbling with my friends (my pastels). After taking formal Indian education and then a conventional job, I realised that simply earning bread and butter without making an impact is wasting this life. Lately I tried to figure out what was I passionate about? Delivering great user experiences was my thing: using my knowledge to build systems, inclination towards art and my ability to understand people very well by talking with them. 

Here are my portfolio links:

## What is Pastels doing at hackathon?
I'm working on a solution to the problem of everyone ignoring fine print (e.g. TOS, EULA, legal documents etc)

## Skills
The tools that help me express my ideas: Pen & paper, Adobe Photoshop, Balsamiq, Invision App, Just in mind, webflow, HTML, CSS.

# Team PhelanGood
One man, on a mission, to save the world through the Koding Global Hackathon. Just kidding.

# About Me
<img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/niC2HLh.png' alt='Hubert'/>

Hi, my name is Hubert Chen. I am a student studying Software Engineering at Monmouth University, which is located in New Jersey, 
USA.

I would like to join this hackathon because it will be a great opportunity to challenge myself to build something that can
create a positive impact. After 4 years of school, I believe I have accumulated enough knowledge to build a full stack system.

As your typical broke college student, winning any sort of prize money would be a extremely helpful. However, given the sheer 
amount of teams (2,000 maximum) and probably being on the low end of experience in the Top Hacker category, the odds of myself
winning are unlikely. This does not deter me. Instead, I hope to try the best that I can and when the competition has subsided, 
analyze other people's work in the hopes that I may find new ways of approaching problems and designing solutions. 

Regardless of whether I get accepted, I would like to applaud the Koding team for hosting this event.

Thank you.

# About the Project
As it isn't the time to learn new technologies, I will be sticking with easy to use and familar technologies. My stack will include: 
Koding for hosting, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery, JS, and HTML.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.

*APIs: Data.gov, Census.gov, WorldBank.org, Ip2Country through MashApe.

*This is bound to change as I am still playing around with a few ideas.

In the present world, where personal computers, mobile phones, and other electrical appliances are widely available, 
big part of the new generation tends to spend most of their time next to the computer, playing video games, or staring
at the news feed. We want to steer the result of this tendency, in words the slathers of youngster's interest forward 
the computers, to a good direction, a useful purpose, which, in long terms could cause the development of the whole society.

PumpedDevs
================
Hey! You've actually visited our page(?). We are pumpedDevs! We're thrilled to be part of the first Global Hackathon, well actually, this is the first hackathon for some of us. :)


About the team
===========================
Hi, we are **pumpedDevs**(pumped developers)! We're composed of 4 developers who love to develop apps for mobile and for web.

The team was created months ago (*May 2014*) before **Koding's Global Hackathon**. The original members were me(Ron), Bryan, and a friend of mine(*Not in the competition*). We established this team because of some reasons and our main goal is to start our own. We wanted to build our own **start up company**. Our problem is, **we don't have any idea how**; also our **time** and **budget** won't allow us. (*We have full-time and part time jobs. Long story on why we can't quit in any.*)

The time when we discovered the **hackathon**, we were so *excited*. But when we saw that there were only 1000(*2000 now*) slots for the hackathon, the excitement went down since we thought that it was somehow *"impossible"* for us(me) to be chosen. But I still tried! I told them, *"If we will be chosen, I will treat you guys!"*. So eventually, I treated them at a coffee shop(Starbucks)!

After a while, I asked the other two members to join us in this hackathon, **Kenneth**, my classmate when I was in college, and **Joell** who used to be our professor. They both develop for the **web** and they're **really great** at it so I thought they'd be perfect for the team and so I invited them. I also had an experience developing with them so I think it's an edge for us.

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *have fun* in the hackathon, *show what we can do* and *what we can contribute*. We think that this event is a **big help** for us to reach our goal which is to create our own **start up company** which can be beneficial for a lot of people. *Winning* in this competition might be **hard** and **intimidating**, but what isn't? We'll give it a shot and do our **best**!

# Team Pusheen

We are students from Taiwan, we love hackathon and enjoy coding!

## About Us

- Chen, Ying Yu: My name is ABin, I love C and Python!
- Cheng, Ya Ju: I'm godow, I love sleep.
- Chang, Wen Kung: My name is imabitch ,I love League of Legends and girls.
- Chen, Chih Lin: My name is Jim,  I love C, C++, PHP.

## Languages we love
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- C/C++
- Python
- PHP
- Java
- Perl
- Shell

## What we want to do
- We aim to do the fifth theme ( Challenges associated with real time communication and translation )
- Since it is a real-time web app, we think PubHub's api may help. And we will also use the google api to process the audio.
- The first application we thought about this theme is a chat room. However, it's kind of boring if it's only able to do communication and translation. Therefore, we want to build it as a game. Users not only communicate, but also attack others with the cannonball formed with translated words. Users will understand the meaning of others' responses, so we think the dialog won't become impolite. The length of sentences in competitor's language and the time of attack may affect the result. We think the users will need some time to find out the strategy to win, so in our opinion, it will be a BRUTAL game!!!

I like the idea of the challenge of a  hackothon as a psychological space well suited to motivating creativity and productivity.  I'm hoping that helps me come up with something interesting and worthwhile outside the scope of my normal work.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm interested in both the theme of realtime communication and translation and the theme of problems facing our planet and data visualization.

I'm not entirely sure what I'd like to tackle specifically.  Perhaps I'll gather some other devs/designers and come up with a more concrete idea soon.

We are a group of technology enthusiasts from Sri Lanka currently based in different parts of the world ;) 

We are motivated to solve real world problems. We have identified that there is a huge gap between legal documents
such as TOS, EULA.. and the end user as they are reluctant to read them. We are on track to a novel and an efficient 
solution to address this issue with the use of latest realtime technologies with usability in mind.

I am a recent graduate of [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/), working at a independent game development company called [Taleworlds Entertainment]. (https://www.taleworlds.com/) Even though I am really interested in the idea, I was not able to participate in more than a couple of hackathons, usually due to the location of most of them being too remote to participate. This one being online is yet another reason that got me excited.

Assignments at school or work may be exciting or educational, but the spontaneity of creativity encouraged in hackathons help get the experience of developing to a whole new level.

I don't think my goal is to win. Rather, it is to produce something that I, and hopefully others as well, would like to make use of.


About our skills and what we are going to do?
=======

The TOS and EULA are one tough nut to crack, but it sure would be fun to tackle it as a weekend project. Any attempt to simplify understanding their coverage would surely require working on the front-end, which would make the implementation part an experimental endeavor to me, as I am more used to working in the back-end. I am still going through the wondrous APIs encouraged, though, and I may end up implementing something based on one (or a few) or them.


---------------------------------------

About your team
===========================

Right now its just me, hopefully will find someone to help take a world vision forward before the 6th.

We are a team of developers from Russia. We are working on their own start-ups, and some of the projects planned as opensource. We have a lot of interesting ideas, but the need to earn money does not allow us to devote much time to their start-ups. On the competition we have learned from the site habrahabr.ru and very interested as an opportunity to talk with other teams, as well as the chance to get funds for the development of our projects. If we win, the prize money will be spent on the development of useful new services and applications.

About our project.
===========================

We not a choose now which of our ideas to put into Hackathon, but as far as technology, the project will be based on Javascript. On the server we use Node.js, client-server communication via web sockets. Other details we will post before Hackaton.

The reason we joined this hackathon was to have a fun way to put our programming/problem solving skills to the test.

Josh and I both have a way of thinking about everything we encounter anything that causes problems or isn't efficient, how
can we fix this? It's this motivation that drives the majority of our projects, the rest of them fall along the lines of, 
"How can we turn this microwave into something useful other than cooking hot pockets?" Either way, it's our passion to make
things that can benefit people in whatever they are doing, making technology work for us, not the other way around.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We tend to work better with html 5 and jQuery, our project will probably 
revolve around web technologies including PHP for our server side code. So
the educational multiplayer game sounds like a likely option for our theme choice.

Passionate Web Engineer, a Self Employed Entrepreneur and father of two. This is my first ever hackathon and I want to use this as an opportunity to learn something new. I am positive that in the end of this event my team will put something valuable on the table. This small effort of us will also have a positive impact to the world in one way or another!

Faraz Ahmed
===========================
I've been doing web development since last six years. Last year, I quit my job where I was going nowhere and took a chance with freelancing - something I never thought I would be successful in. That experiece changed my mind, improved my self-esteem, which was at its lowest point, and defeated my fear of failure. More about that experiece [here](http://farazahmed.co/overcoming-fear-of-failure/). This Hackhaton is an opportunity for me to defeat some more of my fears and bad habits, like never completing what I started, or even getting started on something. I am writing this at the end of the submission of our project and I feel that I've conquered my fears. :)

He is Head of Software Development for his First Tech Challenge Robotics team and also Head of Technology for his school's Physics Club. This year, he carried his team to 113th place out of the over 3000 teams competing in PicoCTF, a computer security challenge. He knows Python, Java, Lua, Javascript, C, Axe, and dabbles in dozens of other languages. He specializes in computer security, GNU and Linux, and networking. Although many people don’t know this and find it hard to believe, William swam for 6 years and dove for his high school swim team.

###Max Krieger

> Max has been doing web development for the past three years, both for fun and for some clients. His projects include [Tabmaster](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabmaster/pojgemmobcnjmnpodjmgeofdgojpkepn), a Chrome extension to help better manage your tabs, and [seae](http://a9.io/Steam-Emoticon-Art-Editor/), a utility for people to create their own pixel art out of the emoticons they own on steam. He programs in full stack js, and has experience in other fields such as game design, UI/UX, graphic design, and photography. He is interested in AI, Control Systems, and eSports.  This is his first hackathon, and he is ready.

I'm also looking for people to join my team that's why I will give you a brief introduction about what I can do and what my skills are.
For the past 6 months I have been working in a company in the area of computational chemistry. I'm involved in projects which
for the most part solve problems with the help of graph theory. This is where my strength lies. I"m also a C# certified specialist
and I have some good amount of experience developing applications & also a good amount of presentation skills. I'm also lucky enough
to be a MSP and MCP. If you are passionate about games and like to create stuff that move please don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm looking for technically skilled persons and design and user interface is going to be the second most important thing.

Thanks !

We are two interaction design/computer science students from Oslo, Hans and Nicolai.

---


**Hans** is currently studying Interaction Design at the University of Oslo. He is originally from Iceland but moved to Norway at a young age where he has lived since. He is an active photographer when not busy with school.
He also enjoys long walks on the beach, candelit dinners and knitting, and practicing pastafarianism.

He coded from a young age with copy-pasting and mixing Javascript snippets on his website made in Frontpage 2000, then did some Visual Basic 6, GameMaker 6 and PHP. He tried to forget that time of his life by drinking copious amounts of Aquavit. He has since then gotten his life together and now develops in a multitude of technologies, for the moment he has a soft spot for Go.


---

Nicolai is at the time being studied at the University of Oslo. ..or was it the other way around?
He is a guitarist in a [big band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band) called Big Boss Band.
He lives in a party mansion, also commonly known as "Mom and Dad's Basement".
He is afraid of the dark, and exceptions in PHP.

**Nicolai** got a flying start with tutorials from W3Schools (A Norwegian site, actually  :no_mouth: , for which we sincerely apologize on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway™ for letting in to this world).

He once developed a CMS targeted towards the elderly to help them manage an event planning site on their own. He is passionate about interaction and user experience and thinks the most important facet of any application is an intuitive interface.  
His graphic design skills can be considered lacklustre, but he compensates with his capabilities as a programmer and makes designs come to life with great care. 
 
---

We love hackathons. Being given the option to creatively and emotionally unfold and unleash the Codebro within, is the best thing in the world (except pure norwegian kebabs). 

Skills and Plans
================
Hans has experience in Go, Python, C, Javascript and loads of tools and libraries for them. He is also capable of designing and creating great and simple user interfaces and interactions for web, desktop and mobile applications.

Nicolai has for the most part worked with web development and the languages and technologies that accompany that field.
That means Javascript for the most part, but also Go and Python. On his spare time he enjoys exercising his brain with languages like Scheme, Standard ML, Scala and Prolog.

Fun fact: The blue cap on Nicolai's image is actually red (read: Mario color) but was Photoshop™-ed by his horrible, horrible ex.

---

We plan to try our hand at an multiplayer educational game using React for interface and Canvas/WebGL. Backend will be written in Go, and we want to try out WebRTC for P2P communication if we get the time.

## About Me

Greetings Koding Hackathon Judges,

I can not express in words how grateful I would be for the opportunity to compete in the first global hackathon. Several years ago I participated as an individual in NASA's ISS challenge (to develop an algorithm to improve solar panel efficiency during low-light orbits). Although my results ranked in the top 1% of entries, I lost my internet connection at the deadline and was not able submit my solution. I have since been waiting for a competition to redeem myself, and this seems like the perfect fit.

I have been fascinated with computers since I was four years old, and have been coding in various languages for over 20 years with an emphasis in web development. While I have a vast general knowledge of modern technology in general, my areas of expertise are primarily related to LAMP, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and ImageMagick, but I also have extensive experience in many other areas.

Since 2008 I have worked as a self-employed developer and information systems consultant. I've developed for a number of companies and individuals, including CCPensieve, The Daily Cafe and 360start.com. For the past two years I have contracted primarily for Idexx Laboratories, Inc. as the lead developer on several internal-use applications. My long-term goal in life is to develop free-use solutions using technology (in the same sense as Wikipedia).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to see you again on the 6th and 7th!

Sincerely,
M. Murphy

TNTeam rocks!

> "I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend."
- Freddie Mercury




## Who we are

TNTeam consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
met at workplace (Rafik, Ibtissem and Marwa happen to be coworkers,
Elyes was an intern in that same company work in) or while attending
Kendo training (Rafik and Chakib are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam
is made of close friends, that all love hacking and fine arts.

* `Rafik` and `Ibtissem` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably write lots of Javascript(On the
browser, and servside as Node.js) even if
they originally love Clojure. They will also join Front-end side if
they have to, but only if there is no other choice.
* `Marwa` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS. She
accouns for three years experience.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps. He will learn a 2D JS Game framework for
this contest.
* `Chakib` is the artist of the team. He will create unique and
  amazing artwork for our project. He actually created our Crest,
  "Freddy Yeah", wearing a traditional Tunisian "Chachia" - a fancy hat.

TNTeam already entered
[Clojure Cup 2014](https://clojurecup.com/#/people/teams), and ended
up third by public votes. So Close!

Here's what we all look like:

Rafik | Ibtissem | Marwa | Elyes | Chakib

## So what are we cooking for you?

TNTeam fell in love with theme 4, which is about designing educational
html5 multiplayer game.

We'll be designing a HTML5 multiplayer strategy/action game to educate
and raise awareness about online privacy and security issues. We'll
try to show, by the means of a small wargame-like, how are people facing
various caveats regarding the ownership of material they share on
social networks, the security and confidentiality of their
communications, the tracing they are submitted when browsing, the
threats of theft of their sensitive data...

## Technologies

To be able to produce the game, we'll (most likely) use a bunch of technologies:

- Web Server : nginx, httpkit (for services and websocket), probably
  some of Node.js facilities.

- Back end Platform: probably Node.js (Maybe using clojurescript),
  with underscore.js, to get advantage from the ease of socket.io,
  maybe some Clojure / Java8 for some other parts.

- Data Store : mongodb or Redis

- Front End : Phaser.io as a HTML5 game engine.

We'll be hosted at a local coworking space,
[Cogite](https://www.facebook.com/Cogite.Coworking.Space). These guys
were awesome enough to allow us to meet and enter the hackathon in
their premices!
Also, we'll be retreating at our mother company,
[appsnsites](https://www.appsnsites.com), but no ads here.

On the very first sight we are ordinary team with team lead and coders. On the other hand each of us is "The One". 
We are personalities with high ambitions, self-motivation and professional background.

We are participating in Hackathon to prove ourselves, get great non-stop-Koding experience and to get fun (Koding is funny, isn't it?).


"Wazzap"
=======
Like most of checked-in teams we are "still brainstormin". We are going to use up-to-date technologies. 
At this moment, seems that we will use PHP/node.js + MySQL/Mongo (maybe hybrid), Angular.js, DataDog API, nginx for server and some of provided APIs (we are not sure yet).


Best wishes
===========
We are wishing all the luck to all participients (ofcourse we have it already taken). Let the Koding begin! :)

Why Tachyon you may ask? Well, a tachyon is a theoretical particle that travels faster than the speed of light.

Hey! I'm a high school student who loves to learn Computer Scince. I've been learning about computers and the web ever since elementary school. Starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to programming languages in middle school such as PHP, and Visual Basic. Now in high school, I have mastered PHP and Java. I have visited Googleplex after becoming the Grand Prize Winner in Google Code-In 2013, the first ever programming contest I participated in. 

I've always wanted to attend a Hackathon, but due to the lack of Hackathons near me, and the long distance I would need to travel, this wasn't possible. When I first heard the news that there was going to be a global hackathon, I was more than thrilled to participate. This will be my first Hackathon, and I am very excited to be taking part in the first global Hackathon!


Skills / Plans
==============
I am interested in theme 5, challenges associated with real time communication and translation. Although PHP is my best language, I will try to use Node.js to solve this problem as you can have real-time direct connections with the server and the client using socket.io. Also, this 'real-time' communication might just be ... faster than the speed of light.

We decided to join the Hackathon for the opportunity to learn and be a part of a large community. This Hackathon will prove individual skills and ways for us to improve certain areas that we lack. Collaborating with various individuals on similar tasks is a fun and educational way to learn coding as well as building something innovative.

About the Team
===========================

We are Team Banana Stand. We're from Toronto, Canada.

| Peony | Manu | Jason | Travis

| <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/498100595962937344/iFcCo2ci_400x400.jpeg' alt='Peony'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000041376391/36373bdf958000782d38565d415c9b43_400x400.jpeg' alt='Manu'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2246824386/badASS_400x400.jpg' alt='Jason'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2218626636/image_400x400.jpg' alt='Travis'/> |

TL;DR: Travis, Peony and Jason are partial-full stack developers and Manu is a janitor. They all share a common love for science.

1. Peony is a web designer and front-end developer. She prefers to work at the bleeding edge of front-end spec, and her workflow would probably make Paul Irish jealous.
2. Manu is not a janitor IRL, he's more like a services savant. If you need service development, or simply some sweet Python magic, he's your man.
3. When he's not busy saving the world from best practice failures or thinking of what to tweet next, Jason is busy building stuff while using a mindblowing variety of resources. Apps, web-apps, APIs, you name it. If Macgyver needed the equivalent of a developer swiss-army knife, Jason would make the role.
4. Travis is a front-end developer who has a lot of experience with devops because it "comes with the territory". In a previous life, he was a backend dev. On that note, he's currently doing his best to hate PHP and love NodeJS.

Joining was Peony's idea, and needless to say, we all jumped at the chance to be a part of global hackathon. Win or lose, we're looking to challenge ourselves by implementing as much as possible into our final idea. 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Python
- Scala
- Objective C
- Java
- PHP

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- DATADOG
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

We're trying to come up with an impressive idea that has a tight-enough scope to complete in time. Ideally this is going to be a web-app that's out-of-the-box in nature, is built on services leveraging a plethora of APIs, and has a gorgeous front end. After throwing ideas around for the past few evenings, the team is mostly talking about going with either themes #1 or #5.

We've worked together for around 3 years, and between us we have over ten years of webdev experience.

Whether it be our own startup or one of the many freelance projects we've completed together, we've always prided ourselves on pushing boundaries and doing new things. So when we heard about the Koding Hackathon, and saw the themes, we jumped right on to the idea.

We can't wait to show everyone our idea.

Goal
=======

We plan to create a real time chat application with a very unique twist, keep an eye out!

Team Hairball is a team of Python hackers who also like to hack the frontend JS. More than winning, we joined to have some fun and hopefully build something awesome. We live and breath for hacking and want to have fun competing with peers.

## Our Project

Project: [Localvore.Guide](http://dev.localvore.guide/)

Localvore.Guide is directory of small, local businesses so that you can be a 
smart local consumer.

Localvore.Guide uses a Django backend powered with PostGIS so we can do fast 
geospatial queries to find the best places near you. On the frontend we've 
implemented Material Design with AngularJS. While right now the app is
hosted on the web, this combination allows us to package the app for Android 
and iOS by just expanding our build process.

I'm the Team Morocco :) I think I'm the only representative of my country (hope there's more ;)).


About the team
===========================

I'm a computer science engineer, I have more than 8 years professional 
experience, but my story with programming has started before graduating.

13 years ago, I have had my first scientific calculator (it's was an HP-48GX)
I was very happy with it and two year after that (I didn't have a computer at 
that time) I have made my first program and it's was my own version of the 
snake game (to be honest it wasn't fully functional :) but I could play with it).

About my skills
=======
Now I'm a java architect with some Oracle Professional Certifications, I can
work with: Java & JEE + frameworks, PHP, JavaScript (Backbone, Angular ...), SQL,
HTML, CSS ... the list is very long :)

# TeamMunkey

I'm Sreejith. I work, I play. Work, most of the time. But my work is my play. I make RC airplanes and play guitar when I'm not coding.

## About Us

- I'm a lone participant. For me, this hackathon is about pushing myself. Squeezing every drip of creative juice out of me in a very short time.

## Languages 

Python does most of the dirty work for me. Objective-C is my another playground. I'm perfecting my Javascript skills. But wouldn't call myself a Sensei yet.

#Team Pooky

It's more than just great that you came up with this Virtual hackathon idea ... because, this may come as a surprise (or not):

###In Slovenia, hackathons don't exist. 

There are no hackathons. Yet. If you want to join one, you have to travel. Once a member of Team Pooky drove to Berlin (that's 1000 km) just for a hackathon. There are computer science oriented events and hackerspaces and good enthusiastic programmers, but - really - no hackathons. Yet.

So you see, we almost _have to_ win - to get the attention to help us start organizing hackathons in Slovenia.

Languages we'll use: that depends on the idea we'll come up with. For now it looks like it's a HTML5 game, games are fun, but it will be educational as well ... a lot can happen in 48 hours :)


---------------------------------------

About QIXIO
===========================
QIXIO is a team creating visionary softwares that combine human intelligent with artificial one. QIXIO dreams that computing will soon be exceed what it had been supposed to be. QIXIO loves narrative intelligence, machine learning, big data, and gaming technology.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
(Probably) HTML5-based multi-platform game or home automation back-end using server technology

TeamShog
========
We are TeamShog. We are a group of high school students from around the world that have picked a really strange name.

Individual Biographies
========
### Noah (Falkirks) <img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/UW8GgAL.jpg?1' alt='alt tag'/>
Noah is an avid web developer, amateur actor and active procrastinator. While avoiding doing school work he is able to find time to write assorted PHP, Java, and JavaScript apps that do somewhat useful things. Noah loves to write beautiful and simple code. 

### Samuel (MegaSamNinja) <img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/pLj79E8.jpg?1' alt='alt tag'/>
Samuel is very talented in lots of ways. He is interested in PHP, HTML, Python and Pokemon. He loves to make code look nice and tidy and adores fixing tiny errors which seem to happen too much. 

### Leon (99leonchang) <img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/HmTm3l3.png' alt='alt tag'/>
Leon is proficient in web design and backend development. He's generally too busy with schoolwork, but in his spare time, loves writing pretty, minimalistic websites that do cool and useful things (at least, in his opinion).

### Adam (TuffDev) <img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/ZpOAbEG.png?1' alt='alt tag'/>
Adam is a mysterious figure who detests the writing of bios.

### "Chris" (PEMapModder) <img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/x2aQ9K7.png?1' alt='alt tag'/>
"Chris" is a nickname of a person whose real name is not wishes to be known. He hates waiting for the OS or websites to respond and loves doing small jobs by writing a PHP script to do them instead, or to memorize long boring URLs. He is also interested in Java applications, although he often ends up creating manyf classes instead. Most of his work stays at his brain, sometimes written on a school notebook. However, he has very few products released as he hates testing.

## About our team

| Ethan | David | Christian | James | Jake

[David]: http://i.imgur.com/hKDsoqJm.jpg "Basic"
[Christian]: http://i.imgur.com/EofphTDm.jpg?1 "at NASA JPL"
[James]: http://i.imgur.com/6WhfoIZm.png?2 "A day in the life"
[Jake]: http://i.imgur.com/IFEuZNEm.png?2 "Khakis"

`Ethan`'s experience lies primarily with Java, although he has dabbled in and is learning other languages. He has published two applications: [En Garde'/>, an Android fencing score-keeping app, and [HyperTyper](http://ethanmad.com/HyperTyper), a Chrome extension that helps (cheats) in online typing competitions. He has little experience with the Web outside of static websites, so he is looking to learn a lot with The Washington Redskins.

`David` is passionate about teaching others how to 'Kode', as demonstrated by his project, [Koding 4 Kids](http://koding4kids.com). Right now, however, his teaching is on hold until we teach y'all a lesson.

`Christian`, also known as 'quantum' or '[paralin](http://parl.in)' is known primarily for [D2Moddin](http://paral.in/the-d2moddin-project/), which brought custom game modes to over 174,000 DOTA 2 players. Christian's in-progress projects include two other DOTA projects, WebLeague and DotaReplay, in addition to his VTOL PixHawk autonomous UAV project. Previous projects are listed on [his website](http://paral.in/projects/) with links to GitHub repositories.

`James` is an algorithms expert and is top 50 on the USACO rankings in 2014. James actually [invented the subordinate-sequential search algorithm](https://koding.com/jlennon1) with the help of fellow Koders. James has also created several published games, including [Nebulus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/nebulous-multiplayer-space/id874328065?mt=8) and [Driftlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/driftlight/id908131148?mt=8).

`Jake` is an esteemed hacker who often goes by the name of '4chan'. He's apparently very infamouss, but you better not tell [CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRcdmbC0HHs)!


## What we're making

We made a site called Living Planet in which we discuss select current problems in the world and visualize them primarily using interactive graphs and charts.

## About Us

-Anshul: I like C#, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Angular, Java.
-David: I’m a Rubyist looking to learn more languages. I also was intrigued by Edward Tufte’s ‘Visual Display of Quantitative Information’ years ago, and I am looking forward to making a ‘User Oriented Display of Quantitative Information’ that can help users realize how they impact the planet. I’m excited about this project, and I’m especially excited about how it applies datamining to a humanitarian task.


---------------------------------------

About the team and team members?

I am Parth Pankaj Tiwary and I am from India, I am currently in the 3rd year of my 4 year bachelors degree in 
computer science and engineering. Data fascinates me and the way we structure our data in order to make some sense
out of it, I have a thing for typography and I am a strong believer of minimalist approach, I do try and keep things
simple.


About the skills that I have or I might use in this hackathon?

I have co-founded one startup that is frameinn.com, I do know Django, python and its recently that I have ventured
for MEAN stack and what can be made using MEAN stack.  I have a thing for data visualization, as it precisely explains
what minimalistic approach is. I guess that is most of it, I will be taking up a project related to the data and the
way we have structured our data so far and how should we go about changing it, in order to put it to its actual use.

#Team: TheHardKoders

So far, it's only me, Subhash Ramesh (coding24by7), on this team. But I expect to make great things in this hackathon!

## About us
- Subhash: I'm a 10th grade hacker. I'm doing my hackathon submission for the High School Hacker category.
- I know many languages (C#.NET/Java/Javascript/HTML/CSS/jQuery/Node.JS/...)
- I love to hack, hack, and hack!

## Languages of expertise in this hackathon
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Node.JS, Express, Meteor (maybe)

## My Project
For this hackathon, I selected the communication and translation theme.

ChatsApp is a global, realtime, and auto-translated chat app that allows users of different languages to speak in real-time (through the PubNub api) as if they were all speaking in the same language! The user specifies his/her language (Default: English), and (optionally) a user name. That's it! Then, the user can type or speak with the mic (only in Chrome) in their own language. However, other users will be recieving the chats in their own languages. In addition, it will be read to them in their language, so it mimics the Star Trek universal translation. The Star Trek universal translation really motivated me.

Microsoft is currently building a universal translation system into Skype, with the same idea, so that really got me interested.

This project addresses the theme behind the Communication theme, because it allows people who speak different languages, to speak with others of different languages in realtime, as if they all spoke the same language!

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of my project in the Koding IDE. It definitely looks better in the browser! ;)

http://d.pr/i/18MR5/1Vj6kDsB http://d.pr/i/1bsZ2/3ggArEKs http://d.pr/i/1ftCO/2zcRQsd4 http://d.pr/i/1fvrI/238rpPp7 http://d.pr/i/1fvrI

## APIs used

- jQuery for faster coding (write less, do more...)

 -WebSpeech API (for text-to-speech and speech recognition)

 -PubNub API (used extensively. this is what drives the realtime aspects of my app, like updated user information and incoming chats. Also greatly reduced the number of API calls made to my NodeJS Server!)

 -Yandex Translation API (As you might have guessed, this API was used for fast translation over 44 different languages! Please do note that this App is on the free plan, hence there will be a limited number of API calls.

The Thought Engineer
================

This is Samer Bechara, The Thought Engineer. I'm participating in this koding hackathon for a change, for a challenge, and winning! (Doh!)


About me
===========================

I've been developing web applications since 2007, and by 2010 I became pretty good - or that's what I like to think.

I've been working online since 2007 , back when we had 128Kbps internet here in Lebanon. For the first few years, my parent and my friends thought I was crazy, but then I understood that I was making money online, not trying to run away from finding a real job.

I've decided to joing because I wanted to challenge myself, and solve some of the problems in your koding themes (No- I'm not telling which one now - we still haven't started!)

I don't care if I win or not, seriously! What I really care about is overcoming myself and pushing my boundaries. Winning is just a secondary result, not the main goal. (Judges - don't let that influence you. I still like to win)


What am I really good at, and what am I going to do?
=======

The more complex the problem is, the simpler the solution I come up with. I've programmed tens of APIs, done frontend and backend programming, managed servers, and market my own business. 

Programming isn't just about writing code, it's about solving problems the world is facing. If you want to kill my soul, ask me to reinvent the wheel. I focus as much as I can on creating innovative solutions for problems that my clients are facing. If a solution has been already created, no need to create it again. Programmers, you can change the world, so stop writing contact forms! :)

Most probably I'll be working on solving the TOS problem. As a website owner and website visitor, it's a problem I fairly undertand and now, and believe that I have some pretty cool ideas to solve this problem.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
======
I love coding, and it is not just my job, it’s my hobby, business, love, my life. 
For the short while I have been on this earth. Developing has been a huge part of my life, so much that if I didn’t have development I would be lost.
I love to play with it, In my spare time I surf the web to keep in touch with new technologies. 
I am working with web applications from last 4+ year.
I am also a nature lover, and I love more than coding, I try to help to save the nature.
I am also master degree student & family responsibilities so I have no much time to physically help them (http://support.wwfindia.org/sos/index.php) but I had decided to donate some part of my salary to them before two months. I also would like to donate 10% of my prize.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I will go with Theme#1 to develop application.

TheTwoPeas
==========
We are two programmers from Hungary and good friends. We live near each other, helped each other developing our programmer skills and until recently used to work at the same place. We are really like two peas in a pod. That’s how we’ve came up with the name. And our nicknames helped: Pali & P. The two P’s. And P sounds like pea, right?!
We are awesome that way…

About our team
==============
Well, you already know where we are from and that we are best friends. And we are programmers. We are used to working together and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Not that we have much of the latter. :) We aren’t afraid of challenges and trying something new.
When not working, Pali plays chess, builds electronic devices and an enthusiastic watcher of TV shows. P likes to play computer games and music on his guitar, listen to music and running.
We joined the Hackathon, because we could not resist the challenge.

Skills
======
We know quite a lot languages and we’re gonna bore you with the list:
PHP, Javascript (Ajax), jQuery, ExtJS, Java, C/C++, C#, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, CSS, XML, HTML.
Pali will do the coding for the problems facing our planet theme (he loves science and his girlfriend is an Earth Scientist, so he listens to that 24/7) and P will do the EULA part because he likes torturing people. Just kidding… :)


---------------------------------------

Briefly describe your team
==========================
We are friends that like to code together. This year we graduated together in computer science at the Free University of Brussels. Surely, this Hackaton will be much fun but we are here also for new skills and experience. 
Oh almost forgotten.. we love beer.



What are your skills?
=====================
First of all, we are computer scientist. So we know a little bit of a lot of things. On the other hand, we are graduates, so we don't know anything. Web development for the win!

---------------------------------------

The Viable Alternative
=========
We are a team of students based in Pittsburgh, looking to make something cool and shiny. 

About our skills and what we're going to do?
=========
We aren't sure what our project is going to be yet, but we'll push an update as soon as we do.

About The Warrior Poet
===========================
My name is Andrew, aged 29 from Wollongong, NSW, Australia.

My journey into game development has been a long one, starting in my young teens with a desire to get into Game Programming. Despite this strong desire, several life choices took me on different paths, including buying my own printing business and running that for over seven years. 

Despite that path, my desire to get into game development remained strong. I started attending university to do a Bachelor of IT/Science double degree, with a software development and mathematics focus. This has eventually led to the desire to specialise in game programming.

In the past few months, I have pulled back from my business in order to focus on game programming and development. Enrolling in an Advanced Diploma, this stage of my life is all about game programming and game development.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Seeing the invitation to the Global Hackathon, I made the decision to join for the purpose of testing and expanding my game development skills. Working alone, I'll be setting out to tackle the theme of using a game to teach software development to a beginner.

I'll be exploring using the Unity3D Game Engine, with it's Unity Web Player to host it on the Koding VM.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We use a lot of open source projects to help us build things faster. We love simple things and of course, Python.
Also, for web developments we prefer Django and Flask. But have tested dozens of other frameworks for web development. In fact, we still mantain a few Php apps right now.
Building apps is our life and we enjoy it very much, we are confident that this is going to stand out in our final product.

More updates comming... :)

# The Y2K Problem

```python
print 'Hello World !'
```
The Y2K Problem is a one-person team for the Koding Hackathon. 
I am [Alex Mathew](https://twitter.com/alxmth03), a final-year Computer Science & Engineering undergrad at [SASTRA University, Thanjavur, IN](http://sastra.edu). 

This hackathon will be a major challenge for me for three main reasons :
* This is my first hacakathon.
* I am a beginner web developer.
* I didn't expect to get shortlisted, so I hadn't tried to assemble a team or decide a project to work on.

But that's the best thing about challenges - they are made to be taken down. I decided to go solo for the hackathon. I will have to dig deep to get this done, and that's the goal now.

## What am I planning to do

I'll be working on a way to introduce software development to beginners, because this is something that I can relate to. I help a lot of people get started with programming, so this hackathon will be a great platform to build a generic solution to help a wider range of people. I'll more specifically work on providing a way to get started with the coding part of software development, because that is the part that looks the scariest to people.

## What will I be using

* Python
* Flask
* MongoDB
* Pubnub API
* Anything else, as the need comes up

Thinker Team
================

We are a team from Indonesia. Basically, we are all DotA players and we love to make applications. DotA is a popular game, developed by IceFrog, and then by Valve Corporation.

At first, we need to name our team as Tinker, like the name of hero in DotA who uses technology in his attacks (and he is from Goblin race who have changed to hyper-intelligent race in World of Warcraft), but later we change it to Thinker (in Indonesian is called "pemikir"). The Thinker also describes our team characteristics, but we do not just think, we also do it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.papolo.com/assets/tinker_s.png"/>
</p>

Indra has made a simple game just to test users' knowledge about streetball and just for having fun in Streetball event in Indonesia, and the feedback is very good. But the application is only available in that event and is not expanded for further use.

Considering that feedback, we want to build a little similar game as that streetball game, but we will expand it so it can be used generally, not only for streetball event. We see a lot of potentials in this game. Any companies, any schools, any organizations, even any people from any parts of the world can use it to test his/others knowledge with a funnier way. This game can be used for many things, depend on the perspective and the goal of the people who use this.

Tooring Analytics
================

Hello, this is the 'Tooring Analytics' team..well, just one guy, actually. :-)

About your team
===========================

My name is Anshuman K, and I split my time between London & Pune, India.


Skills
=======

So-called "Full-stack" :).
Python, R, Java, Scala, Android, CSS/HTML + JavaScript.
Experienced systems programmer but now interested in Machine Learning/AI, Statistics.

What am I going to do?
=======

Climate change is a pretty contentious topic -- there are the believers, the deniers, and then the wise ones who know the facts or who know they don't know the facts. Sometimes the only way you can be sure temperatures are rising is pitting the believers against the deniers in a climate change debate.

My idea is to build a forum that puts publically available climate change data centrestage, and thus spark a rational & insightful debate about the data -- to cut through the hysteria and the stubbornness and provide an environment where the data can speak for itself -- through visualization, of course.

# Introducing <a href="#"><img src="http://www.designledge.com/clients/codefeud/logo.jpg" alt="codeFeud"></a>
<a href="#">codeFeud</a> is a multiplayer HTML5 game designed to teach programming to both beginner and advanced developers using the “learning by doing” teaching methodology. Specifically, players compete against each other by solving simple, intermediate, or complex programming questions within a predetermined timeframe. The player with the fastest and smallest solution to the problem wins the round and advances on a digital game board. The first player to reach 10 on the game board wins the “feud” and increases their rating for future matches.

# The TripleJ team
Jørgen, Jacob, and James (TripleJ) came together for 48 hours to dream up, design, and develop codeFeud with a vision of inspiring more people to code in a fun and engaging way. That and the prize money, bragging rights, and recognition was pretty sweet.

Jørgen from Norway:   Font and back end developer / project lead<br>
Jacob from Russia:    Back end developer / database mastermind<br>
James from USA:       Designer and front end developer / obsessive detailer<br>

Hola! I know I am very very late but still try my chance to join.
I believe in Java ^^

Prompt: 1

"In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Beloit College underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as koders of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The Turtles."


Joe Peacock, Ellery Addington-White, and Hunter Elbourn, we are all computer science majors at Beloit College.

Joe: Runner, skier (cross country), and professional chef.  Enjoys long walks on the beach.
Ellery: Entrepreneur, and general whiz kid (even though hes the oldest on the team).  Enjoys snowboarding with his half brother Shawn and his father Walter.
Hunter: Likes physics, computers, camping, sci fy movies, and wearing large coats.

Bees?  It's not just a cards against humanity reference any more.  Bee colonies across the world are dying, and nobody is completely sure why!  If I was prone to hyperbole I would say it is a threat to the survival of the entire planet!  If I was prone to realism I would mention the bees are crucial to pollinating crops which are necessary for the stability of biomes, not to mention the fruits, veggies, grains, and other photosynthesizing organisms we as people like to eat.

So, problem established.  But on twitter, #beedeath has shown up twice since Halloween.  People don't know, because if they knew, they would have to care. Hence, we should make people care.  Thus BeeRescue!  Through making data more accessible, and collecting some of our own, we bring the abstract concept of 'bee death' into the center of the human consciousness. We want to bring bee death information into the public realm. Or... at least we made you think about it.

UniLasers
=============

We're team UniLasers, a small team of two people based out of Toronto. We consider ourselves hobbyist programmers, we enjoy programming but don't have enough chances to do so at work or after work. Neither of us have ever participated in a Hackathon before, but this global Hackathon seems like a great place to begin! 

It's time to see how well we stack up against the other 1999 teams in this Hackathon! 

What we're going to do
=============

Honestly, we're not sure yet. One of us is stronger with backend technologies, one of us is better with frontend, so we'll see how that goes.

We're still deciding between the first and third theme as those two plays to our strengths, we'll commit a change to this file once we decide!

For sure we'll be making use of PHP, nginx, and a bunch of JavaScript libraries that can help us code fast in 48h. Any other APIs and technologies will be determined once we decide on a theme.

What are your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

Short of traditional languages (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C++, e.t.c..), I understand programming concepts such as MVC, Graph Theory, Lazy Propogation, Synchronous/Asynchronous operation, and data normalization among other things. 

As a web developer, I've both written and read TOS's, and it's annoying either way. There must be some sort of compromise or solution to this, and I think I've found away.

You see, that way is...

Welcome to 'Vagos' team page!
===========================

Hello, we are a mexican team, all the members are engineering students in Toluca city, very near of México city, we fall in love with software development and imposible projects, it is our first hackathon.

Our team is called 'Vagos' inspired in a popular word in México, a few people use 'vagos' to identify those guys that spend a big time in streets learning a lot of skills from the real life, at university, we call vagos to those guys that spend a lot of time learning  technologies and programming languages used in real amazing apps and that not teaching inside universities.

<h2>What if we win?</h2>
<p>If our team wins the hackathon, we want to use the opportunity to demonstrate that regardless of the country and social status, everybody can get access to incredible knowledges of technology through internet, on the other hand we want to inspire to other students to go ahead and learn by themselves the technologies and programming languages used to create amazing web apps in a different way that university currently teach us, but more like in real world in real great apps. We want to encourage to younger students in engineering to create incredible things to improve the world with web technology.</p>

Yet Another Team
================
Hello hackers/koders!

As you might have noticed by now, this team is called "Yet Another Team" (yes, not the most creative name).

About the team
--------------
This is a "single-member" team.

Just like you probably are, I am just another enthusiast, who believes that he can contribute (even in a small way), to a better world.

The name is inspired by the Linux community, which widely uses the "YA" acronym.
I highly admire this community, that is well-known for providing clever ideas, often in an altruistic way.

Although winning one of the categories would be very nice, this is not what drives me to join this contest.
It is the idea that I can contribute to help people, in some way, what drives me.

About my skills and purpose
---------------------------
I currently work as a Technical Support agent for a partner of a well-known network corporation.

It is my hobby to program (in various languages, including PHP, JavaScript, Java and C++).
My dream is to become a good programmer, for this is what I enjoy the most.

I consider myself a hacker, since I like to customize things to work better for me.

I would like to address the need for a better way to deliver legal documents (EULA, TOS), although I cannot provide a lot of details, at the time.


---------------------------------------

## Hi, I'm Jeremy.
### I'm a recent college graduate of the University of California, San Diego. I'm taking some time off before I start working, and I'm using this time to do things that I didn't have too much time for in college. Some of these things include working on my own projects, playing more guitar, writing, and reading more books.

### I decided to join the Koding Global Hackathon because I love making things, and this is just another opportunity to do so.

## What am I doing?
### I'm not sure yet, but it's probably going to be something related to my passion of enabling others to pursue their passions. I've done a lot of STEM outreach back in college, so maybe I'll create a game. I'll update this later.

Shameless selfie taken at 5:30AM.. After a solid-ish 40-ish hours of Hackathon coding :D

---

Hello there, this is my on-man team page for the first Global Hackathon!

I'm a one man band and embarking on this challenge alone, let's hope I can manage. As a student in my last year of Sixth form in the UK, I've had to teach myself eveything I know about coding.
I started coding very early, maybe when I was 6, and loved it even at that age. Through the years, I've never stopped learning, and love a hard challenge.

Most of my free time is dedicated to hobby coding projects and hacking electronics!

I decided to participate in the Koding Hackathon because I love a challenge, and work well under pressure. Even if what I make in the end is no more than a demo, I'm sure I will have great fun making it and mingling with the Koding community!

===

##Skills:
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JS
 * PHP
 * MySQL
 * Java
 * C
 * C++
 * Pascal
 * Assembly (x86 with SSE&MMX)
 * Haskell
 * Ruby
 * Game Maker Language
 * Python
 * REST-API
 * NodeJS
 * JQuery
 * The list goes on...
 
But for the Hackathon, I think I'll mainly stick with PHP/HTML5/MySQL/JS/CSS5 maybe a smidge of C++ for backend... we'll see.

##The final product

Hacking is over for me.. I'm going to catch some rest... finally :D It's been a great coding weekend, I leave you with a demo of what you can do on http://ellisvlad.koding.io/ : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4vsT4hoKhs&feature=youtu.be">Demo on Youtube</a>

Had some laughs.. Had some cries.. All in all, pretty great hackathon.

# banas

banas is a single-person team comprising [this kid](http://twitter.com/SarupBanskota).


# whoami

I'm Sarup Banskota, undergrad student and the usual tinkerer. I have my sememster finals going on. Sleeping wouldn't make a great excuse to friends who'd like me to *group study*, so I decided to strike point 8 off my [ideas list](http://sarupbanskota.github.io/ideas.html) instead.


# the_big_idea

If I had a $ for every time a junior/friend/parent asked me how to [contribute to Free Software](http://www.slideshare.net/sarupbanskota/sarup-fossasia-1), [plan a college club event](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Coimbatore_Fedora_Contribution_Camp) or [make the printer work](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=printer+not+working), I would consider sponsoring this hackathon.

All of us have seen some variant of those links, and while I agree the resolute ones will make the best use of it, most folks need things to be presented information in a manner they're comfortable with:

> If it's on Wikipedia, it must be right.

I'd like to build a platform where people who want to share can list a bunch of resources in a consistent manner. It's going to be community driven. I want to make it free (as in freedom, beer optional). 

Oh the thought of being able to provide a [sarupbanskota.islearn.in/programming](http://www.irishslang.info/images/funnyimages/Funny-meme-I-changed-my-passwords-to.jpg) that everyone can share around :)

# the_big_plan

With the exams around, I have humble hopes at the moment. Thanks to the hackathon excitement, I'd like to get the project kickstarted and see how it rolls from there.

I'll publish everything on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/sarupbanskota/everytrack), so that's where you go to follow the action.

Cheers!

Koding's instructions for writing ABOUT.md tell you to make it emotional and impressive. I find it more important to make it honest. I'm Frederik Creemers, a Belgian web geek. I'm visually impaired. My optic nerves never fully developed, so glasses don't help.
Because of my impairment, I've always needed the help of technology. In high school, at a point where I was supposed to be doing homework, I started toying around in powerpoint. I found out a feature that allowed you to go to a different slide when the mouse hovered
over a certain element of the current slide. This gave me the great idea to create mouse mazes, where you had to get your cursor from start to finish without touchhing a wall. This got me more interested in how games were created, and so I  downloaded GameMaker, a tool by YoYoGames,
that allows you to create games without programming. It does include a language called GML (game maker language), which was my introduction to programming. At school, we learned how to make a website, which introdduced me to the wonders of the web as a platform, and that's what got me to where I currently am.

The reason I'm entering this hackathon, is because I sometimes need a little push to release something. I've got a lot of projects in my 'dev' directory that are hafway there to being something I could release to the world. I'm hoping that this hackathon will push me to create something that I can be proud of.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm creating an app that allows people without any coding experience to create their own web application.
Some of the things I'll probably use:

 - blockly
 - github's api
 - Google App Engine
 - Any other APi I can build in in time that can enhance the applications that users build.
 
I might change my mind, and build applications using firebase instead of App Engine.

c0D3 mUNCH3R5
================

The name was chosen after Sophia proposed "code munchers" and Wiliam proposed the l33t version. Alan likes plain English better.


About us
===========================

## Sophia
I like building and learning things! Ya, that’s pretty much it. I really tried to make this more interesting and then I realised I was a boring person. And then I was like, hey, lets add a meme. Then I was like, “no, memes are to mainstream, I’m a software person, I can’t be mainstream.” So in the end: what is a computer scientists favourite beat: an algo-_rhythm_

## Alan
I have participated in many hackathons, mostly for fun. Many of the times I just do them because I have nothing better to do. Unlike many, I don’t have a _fiery passion_ for coding, but I find it interesting enough that I do hackathons.


## William

William didn't actually participate in the event, other than partly picking the name. He is kept here as an "honorable mention".


Our project
=======
> "The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance."

>  \- Nathaniel Branden

To solve world problems, we have to be aware of them first. Conflict mapper is designed to help raising awareness in young people about conflicts that happen aboard. We achieve this by aggregating news feeds about world conflicts and displaying this to the user in the form of a heat map. We also provide the user with links to articles that make up our dataset.

I'm planning to work on topic #2 (Introducing software development to a beginner (games!)).

<h1><b>This is our page</b></h1>

<em>Well actually it's just me for now. I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina, currently living in Sarajevo.</em>

<h1><b>About your team</b></h1>

<img src='https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10462897_340526402793483_5136123533379743807_n.jpg?oh=a4bbd3ec555369ef01d095d2b23e5054&oe=54FA3C76&__gda__=1425953052_55e3cb1157c2cbffa69397dc17264381'>

<em>My name is Emina Šahbegović, I am twenty-one years old and I am a second year student at International Burch Univercity in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia. I have decided to try and join the hackaton because I am a curious person and like to take as many 
opportunities as possible to gather more knowledge when it comes to programming. I have fallen in love with 
programming and would like to become one of the best programmers in this world, but since I started relatively late compared to 
my colleagues it will probably take some time till I get there. I would really like to become one of the best programmers for 
two reasons. First reason would have to be so I can pay my family everything back that they invested in me and finally be 
independent. The second reason is because I really respect smart people and would love to become a smart person who is needed 
in society.</em>

<h1><b>Abut your skills and what you are going to do?</b></h1>

<em>Since my skills in coding are still at a beginners level, it's possible that it won't kick people from their chairs but 
I will try to make the best project I've made yet. I do have some skills wehn it comes to design and art so hopefully it will 
make up a little for the lack of knowledge in coding. I will give the first theme a try and, hopefully, it will be interesting.</em>

##Alan

Just a high schooler on the east coast who wants to test his skills. 
I doubt I will win, but I just want to see what participating feels like. 
Never really knew what I wanted to do until my first day of Freshman year, when I walked into Computer Science class Period 1. Hello World in Java seemed magical to me, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I "grew up".
Since then, I've tried to learn as much as I can, as fast I can. I found myself overreaching at one point, trying to become a coding polyglot- I was trying to learn 3 or more languages at once, which did not work. So I focused on learning a few things, and learning them well.
  And I got an internship at an informatics lab! 

##Kevin
  Known as "Bear". Algorithm master and High School math wiz. Straight out of ~~Compton~~ Longmont.
  I'm pretty sure I'm cooler than Alan. I think. CSS is my specialty and Netscape is my favorite browser.
  I like to work with C/C++, so if you need help, I'd be happy to give you some **pointers**.

#Skills/Experience
##Alan: 
Javascript, Java, HTML/CSS, a little Python and Ruby.
D3.js, Node, Sails.
##Kevin:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, C.


We want to make an interactive website to explain and visualize the changes in global temperature over the years.
Obviously, we'd use d3.js for that. Planetary.js, which uses d3, would be nice for easily plotting the globe.
Another cool idea would be a way for people to highlight the most important parts of a legal document for users to read and then some sort of game to make sure people read those sentences, at least.

# dankokp

The team is really small and consists only of one member

## About

Hi! My name is Dzianis. I'm a software developer with 3+ years of experience in iOS development. At this moment I'm living in San Francisco Bay Area. I like to learn something new and Koding Hackathon is a great opportunity to get outstanding knowledges in really short terms.

## Languages which I'm going to use in hackathon

- PHP
- JavaScript


---------------------------------------

###Welcome to darapti!


###About me
P. Coleman.
* College student
* Philosophy major
* Formal logic geek
* Solo novice developer


###What in the world's a darapti?
<p>Darapti is one of the valid categorical syllogisms in formal logic, as constructed by Aristotle.</p>
<p>A syllogism is an argument consisting of two or more premises and a conclusion. It uses deductive reasoning to arrive at the conclusion from the premises.</p>
<p>There are 256 possible syllogisms, but only ~20 valid forms.
However, Aristotle's system proved hard to memorize alone (too many darn vowels), so the medievals created mnemonics for the valid forms.
Darapti is one of them.</p>
(paraphrased from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism))


###Darapti as a syllogism: 
```
Premise: All hackathons are fun events.
Premise: All hackathons are strenuous events.
Conclusion: So, some strenuous events are fun events.
```

###Why darapti?
1. Darapti is a weakened form. For the conclusion to be true, it must assume that the terms in the premises are.</p>
2. It's a reminder for me to check all parts of my program and make sure they function. Otherwise, just like an argument, it'll fall apart.</p>
3. Logic is how I gained the confidence to code.
4. Darapti also rolls off the tongue well (dah-rahp-tee).</p>

###Why hackathon?
1. Why not?
2. I've been sitting on my butt with some ideas, but haven't been inspired to build them yet.
3. I like the opportunity to try to build something in a limited time frame.


###Skillset and Ambitions
* a cup of PHP/MySQL
* a pinch of JavaScript
* a dash of HTML/CSS
* I'll create either an educational game or something to help with the fine print.
* Not sure of specific APIs at the moment.

We all live in the same city and know each other personally, but never tried
to work as a team... though some of us do work together. So why not try?  
After all, who would resist an opportunity to spend 48 hours coding? :)

**Sergey** is a team lead by trade and he was trying to lead this team too, though in this case he had competition as the idea of the project hasn't originated from him. He's a great proffessional, very driven and commited wholly to coding.

**Yurks** is the best UI developer we've ever had an honour to work with. He's also the tallest team member, which usually allows him to have the best place in a taxi cab (near the driver). Otherwise his long legs wouldn't fit.

**Oleksiy** is one of those people you envy, because they can do anything they put their mind to. He's literally Google material, so suck it up, Google, he's with us and we ain't gonna part with him for no reason. Unless of course he wants to.

*rudeg* is simply Javascript God. He was teaching us, mortals, ReactJs for the whole two days.

**Marina** is the most beautiful software developer you have ever seen, seriously. And she's tolerably smart, too. She is also fond of cats, bears, hedgehogs, knitting and the like :)

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are two Java, one Python, and two Javascript developers.
Chances are that we're going to code in a completely different stack
(Clojure/ClojureScript?) though. 

Our goal is to scratch our own itch and to build a service that would help to write better in foreign languages.  Natural languages, I mean, like English.

spellcheckr.io
==============

Do you have to write in a language that you feel you don't know too well? Are you a student and study foreign languages? 
Maybe you need to write an occasional email to a client and you're not sure you
can express yourself well enough?

Do you ever feel like Master Yoda?
You are supposedly great and mighty. But people still hide their smiles when they listen to you.

Why is that? Because you **speak funny.**

>>> “Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path,
forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Suppose Master Yoda used our service before he made this speech!
This is what he'd be likely to get:

>>> “Anger, fear, aggression; they are the dark side of the Force.
They flow easily an are quick to join you in a fight. Once you start down the dark path,
it will forever dominate your destiny, it will consume you, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Not so funny anymore huh?
What we offer is a proofreading service with users ready to help you around the clock.
World is wide; when they sleep in Australia, they are wide awake in Austria! Which is
exactly what makes your chances to get a quick, real-time response all the better!

So, if you want to improve your writing, hop in in and post your text snippet here!
Or if you feel like you should be the one proofreading others, by all means join
our forces on the other end of the channel! Just switch to the Suggestions page and fire away!

Members: 
Torrin - shinymoose

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

I orginally sent in the application to this hackathon hoping it would unite the creative minds at CCoWMU.org.
CCoWMU is the computer club at Western Michigan University, many of us are introverts and have a hard time coming
out of that shell and I hoped this event would unite us. It has not quite had the desired numbers but I have made some 
good friends and we are here to make TOS more interactive so people have a better idea of what they are agreeing to
when joining a site. 


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Our skill sets lay primarily in back end web development and databases. We hope to create a creative way to read TOS using nodejs.

I am currently an undergraduate student in my pre-final year studying Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

In my spare time, I like to do web and mobile application development using cross platform JavaScript tools. 

See my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/grey93) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/_grey93) profile for more.


Submission
=======

I have built an app under the theme
> HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented. (multiplayer preferred)

My game idea is a simple yet fun addition game called [**proximus**](http://ugkkaf048439.grey93.koding.io/) 
that allows young children to understand the fundamentals of addition, while at the same time having fun.
However, addition isn't the only component involved here, it's also brainy as hell, so adults can have fun too.
The Application was built on [node.js](https://nodejs.org) using the [express](http://expressjs.com) web server.
It is a clone of the popular flash game ***proximity***.
For more implementation related details, see the [github repo](https://github.com/grey93/proximus#proximus).

Welcome to Hawaii Hackers
================

I am a student studying computer science at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. Tried to get people to join, but I was the only one crazy enough to try and balance a hackathon, and a Software Engineering project that culminates in a demonstration before a review board next week. Go me!

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10357807_10153006617253009_6237015540130397559_n.jpg?oh=8294e964499a33fb1c2096e309d475f3&oe=55001B5D&__gda__=1426433032_8b16c41f14b47360b3ae64a72ccea70e' alt='maui'/>


About your team
===========================
I'm a Senior in the Computer Science department at UH Hilo. I first came to Hawaii in search of a fresh start back in December of 2007. 
I didn't really know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I did know I needed a way to make a living. I took a job with a
large ornamental plant farm. It was hard work, and the pay was just barely enough to get by. Yet, in spite of all of this, riding around
on a tractor all day gave me a great deal of time to think. And as I thought, I realized that I didn't want to ride around on a tractor all day for the rest of my life. 

I enrolled at Hawaii Community College in its Information Technology program back in the Spring of 2009. Going back to school breathed
new ambition and new life into my soul, and so I decided to leave the farm and eventually took a job with Upward Bound, a college prep for
low income and first generation high schoolers, as a tech instructor for their Summer Academy. They were pleased with the way I interacted
with the students, and with my knowledge of computers, and ultimately offered me a position as their IT Specialist.

I graduated from the IT Program in the Spring of 2011 at the top of my class. From there, I made the decision to transfer to UH Hilo's 
Computer Science Program. The CS Program has taught me a love for programming and problem solving that I never knew I had. I became extremely
interested in AI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Datamining, and have been supplementing the education I've received with free online courses from
Coursera and Udacity. I am also an active member of ACM, and have particpiated in two Intercollegiate Programming Competitions, as well
as the NYU Poly  Cyber Security Awareness Week Capture the Flag, Google Codejam, and IBM's Master the Mainframe.

My studies keep me very busy, but I do manage to get some downtime in where I like to hit the beach, go diving with my father, play video games, or practice jujitsu. As my education comes to a close, it is unclear if I will be able to remain in this amazing place that has 
changed my life so much, but winning this competition would certainly be a step in the right direction.  

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
As I mentioned above, my main interests fall along the lines of AI, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Datamining, so I definitely plan to use my knowledge from at least one of these domains. I may take a whack at the real time communication theme, but being an educator myself, I may go in the direction of creating an interactive activity for first time software developers. API wise, I see a lot of interesting API's on
Mashape, and API Tools, so plan on seeing API's from at least one of these sites. Moreover, I'll probably use QUANDL if I find that I need a large dataset unless I find a suitable dataset elsewhere.

## About

I programmed in many languages before. I really do love the idea of funcational programming
and it has managed to creep its way into my C programming.. Eek!

For prototyping I use processing, arduino and python. Since this is a hackathon, something tells
me I'll be coding in processing this hackathon!

## Quick overview of idea
A game written in processing accompanied by teaching material and good documentation.

The learning theme, simply put.

Okay, that wasn't too revealing :D Happy hacking!

# megusta

I'm Ivan and I just looooooove little software and hardware helpers that make life easier.
But sometimes little things overgrow to big ugly monster, so it's better to kill them than develop -__-.
I hope, this time I'll focus on one thing and won't use whole bucket of technologies
just for one simple purpose. :)

# What skills do I have?

Well, I'm kinda web developer with mixin of mobile developer who can speak following languages
(and speaks them in daily life):

 - PHP
 - golang
 - C# (Silverlight)
 - Javascript

My idea is to work on gathering and processing one kind of statistics that will serve well to 80%
of possible users. I'll focus on usability, because "usable" thing means "something that helps me
every day".

#This mikedamike
mikedamike is focussed on delivering fast and useful code

#About the team
Mike is the core of this team and others float in and out of it from time to time.
Mike is a technofile: he loves learning, teaching and living code, gadgets and all things technical.

What makes mikedamike unique is the approach taken: The pursute of fast and useful code. Many may code more quickly or in a more targetted manner. But there is or should be more to coding than the fewest commands or the least time to delivery.

Coding (or should I say Koding??) for mikedamike is about finding both fast and useful through learning. This learning is not just the pursute of coding technics or new ideas. Though both are great, neither really touches the core issue.

Software is for people. To write a truly great program, you must walk the proverbial mile in the users shoes and make them not only what they ask for or even only what they need, but dare to dream their dreams and deliver what they will want before they even know they want it. Dare to experience things through their eyes and hands and hearts.

Its already late if we deliver after they feel the need. And so, that is the basis of the 'Fast and Useful'. Not an attempt to just make money, or even a name, but an attempt to help others, by knowing them better.

#mikedamike's skills
Really there just isn't much that mikedamike doesn't have for skills in the tech world.

This will be updated soon with more detailes.

I believe this hackathon will push new ideas to my mind and help me get things done. 
I think this is a good starting point for creating your own app from scratch.
And, hey, who knows, maybe this time it will find theirs users.


The Project
=======
I want to implement something helpful and distraction free tool for daily usage. 

Something that you can setup for your needs.
 
I'd like to use AngularJS and MongoDB with simple NodeJS server.

Why did I decide to join?

I have intense inclination towards technology. My first project on technology was at the age of less than 5 years when i never knew what is technology. Mother nature inclined me towards it.

Everyone knows that time will keep going ahead. What is so special about it? The speciality is that at any point of time the world is new.

The super speciality of this age is availability of all the vast ocean of informations. We just need to imagine what information do we need.

Hackathon has given me the opportunity to imagine what i want to do. I will do it.



why I want to win.
=======

I am from a very small Village called Liluah in Westbengal, India. I want to be the Inspiration to all the people to come ahead and make the world the best place to live.

Every bit of our efforts will play a role in bring about better tomorrow.

My Winning will be a strong spark to ignite the sleeping motivation to bring a true world of technology into real existance.


About my skills and what you are going to do?
=======
lots of languages to mention. 
- PHP
- Javascript
- HTML5
- MySQL
- Web speech API
- Lots of frameworks

What is my theme
======
My theme is : developing interactive method so that people can read fine prints.

Something unique? ya
Eye tracking studies have shown that people do not read long pages.
Smaller boring fonts dont appeal.

What is needed is :
Beautifu layout.
Happy feeling.
Speech API will speak the content, so no chance of not reading it. Subconscious brain will be able to listen it.

We are using all possible ways including the psychology 
Human brain prefers reward center. Rewards and happiness are the key factors.
Multiple senses like vision and hearing both can be stimulated at the same time.

Animated character to help you not get bored and keep you attached.

See it to believe it.

#About this singleton

###Who, me?
I am Prajogo Tio, an (computer) engineering student from *Nanyang Technological University*, Year 2.
I have just started learning about programming more or less 11 months (I started learning in December 2013).
Since then I've been hooked by the computing world and wanted to gain ever more awesome experience.
I might be very green and incompetent (I admit it) but I believe I have to start somewhere.
That is my main motivation in participating in this Hackathon, and hopefully I might have the chance to compete.

###Interests
I've enjoyed programming several HTML5 Games using mainly Javascript and Canvas. 
Two main games I've written so far are:
  1. A 2D side scrolling spaceship game to test out prototypal inheritence in JS. [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/Space/Space.html)
  2. Another one is 2.5D FPS game (I call it BOOM) based on Raycasting principles to emulate 3D in 2D engine. Pretty fun! [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/boom/boom.html)
You may want to check out my Github IO page to test them:
[prajogotio.github.io](prajogotio.github.io)

I'm also actively participating in algorithm contests just to keep my mind in check. I love learning and I will never stop.
I do keep a log on what I've learnt in my blogspot: [abitofcs.blogspot.sg](abitofcs.blogspot.sg)

###Hopes
I am looking for a chance to strengthen my foundation in code design and planning. I hope I get a chance to learn from this Hackathon.

Thank you for taking your time to read this page.

Regards,
   Prajogo Tio

###UPDATE: Another Member!

###Knock, knock, who's there?
He is Andhieka Putra, an enthusiastic Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate from National University of Singapore. Github: [github.com/andhieka](https://github.com/andhieka). He really likes to play the guitar and he is making an app to help newbies learn to play the guitar. He calls it the [Guitar Academy](https://github.com/guitar-academy).

We have been friends since eternity.

We will be working together to bring out the best of our abilities :D :boom:



---------------------------------------

My name is Philip Tolton. I'm a software developer.

I recently built a startup called DishGo. I built incredible software for over a year. We made some money and my software was used by thousands of people. I'm now looking for my next challenge.

I've used Rails, Objective-C, Linux, Javascript, MongoDB, Mysql and much much more. I'm building a custom router out of a Banana Pi right now. It's running Arch Linux.

I have some free time and a buddy suggested I sign up for this. I'm going to build something really cool.

I think I'm going to use some OCR technology and integrate it into Quickbooks. There were some things I was forced to do for DishGo when it was time to do our taxes that were really painful. I think they can be automated.

About reCode
============

Team reCode consists of just me, Aviral Dasgupta, a current undergraduate Computer Science & Engineering student at KIIT University, Bhubaneshwar, India. I've been programming since I was twelve and have dabbled in everything ranging from homebrew dev for the Gameboy Advance, to web development.

I like using technology to build smart solutions that get out of your way, but get your work done.

About Skills
============

I can comfortably switch from backend to frontend, and mobile. This project in particular will consist of an Android app with a Python backend deployed on Google AppEngine and a realtime frontend for the web.

# Team revolTOS

We are Federico, Paulo, Carlos, Eduardo and Rita, and we can basically can fix from a radio to a CT scanner, we can design circuits with logic gates, with PICs, with microprocessors and even micro-controllers. We used to mention the languages we know how to code with... Lately it's easier to say that Ruby on rails and Python are not our thing, but we can even code in ancient mayan!

Besides that, with Eduardo we complement our coding skills with artistic design, which makes our creation a real piece of art. Carlos provides the business insights to make revolTOS an always market-oriented/market-driven group. Paulo and Rita design our products in such a way that the user experience goes as a charm. And Federico builds the backend to make sure our products are meaningful.


<h2>Carlos Boto</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/carlosboto.png"/>

Since an early age I have been fascinated by the idea of creating economic value through disruptive
technologies and by the impact of such projects in society. I work on technology transfer projects, product
identification, market analysis, finding strategies to market entry and financial analysis. I dream about the
day where the interface between Research / Business / Finance disappears, contributing this way to
global development.


Federico Cismondi <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/federicocismondi.png"/>

I think of myself as a “data-driven person”, somebody who likes to dig deeply into collected information
and then look for the facts in order to make decisions based on them. Also, since the early stages of my
career I have had a self-driven, self-motivated way of encompassing work in multidisciplinary
environments, sometimes having limited or no supervision at all, and still achieving or surpassing the
expected goals.


<h2>Paulo Melo</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/paulomelo.png"/>

I think of myself as an engineering artist. I understand how people interact with problems, interfaces and
situations, and creatively define structures to facilitate those interactions. I have multidisciplinary
experience in design and product development to successfully guide the product to market.


<h2>Eduardo Nunes</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/eduardonunes.png"/>

I am a cross-media designer, a student, a teacher, a researcher and I am absolutely passionate about digital beauty. I love web design and reflecting the way I see the world, a problem and its solution in the simplest and most possibly touching way. I have experience in many types of coding, which provides me with the tools to execute a project from the conception, to the design, to the development.


<h2>Rita</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/ritaoliveira.png"/>

I am an engineer till my last fiber. I like looking at situations and tasks, evaluate the way they are done, and improve the interaction with them. I am passionate about coding and user experience, and I focus my work in making people's life easier. Human-machine interfaces should be simple and intuitive, and I wake up everyday aiming at that!

All the team members are Computer Science Undergraduates from University of Moratuwa. And love learning new
technologies, and we can't think of any other better way to learn than by applying the things that we learned. 

Judges will read this page before making a final decision, so write your story, make it emotional and impressive.
Tell us why you want to win.


What we plan to do... 
=======
We plan to create an interactive HTML5 game to help novice programmers and non-pogrammers quickly master the basics of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. The site will use Facebook graph API and some other APIs as well.

Serglider
===========================
Hey hackers,

I'm Sergey, a single member of the seglider team. My planet rotates around Javascript star which is in the Frontend galaxy.



Project
=======
I'm planning to develop a web app that will teach people not familiar with IT some of its aspects.

Team ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
===============

This is Team I-Didn't-Have-A-Better-Name-For-It or Team ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ for short.

I like web technologies, specifically building on top of already powerful services and extending them. For example, taking the WUndgeround weather API and using sunset time to turn the lights in my house on. Or by combining Rotten Tomatoes and Redbox to find critically acclaimed movies that I can immediately pick up (that is if I can be bothered to put on pants).

I move bits around.


My Skillz
=========

Like I said, I really like web technologies so I'll be developing in PHP5 with some Python as a backend, HTML5, and jQuery. Probably use Bootstrap since I'm a terrible designer

Right now, I'm thinking of visualizing or re-thinking how people look at some government data. Which agency's? And in what ways?

I enjoy coding, especially when it involves doing something more creative than the norm. The challenge of doing so in a contest atmosphere seemed like it might be a lot of fun, and the themes make it even more interesting. I'm really looking forward to participating - I had hoped my teammates would have been able to join me this weekend to make it even more fun, but even on my own is still going to be rewarding and enjoyable.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm aiming to do something interactive, fun, and educational, at the very least probably using jQuery. Eveything else will probably be decided on the fly!

---------------------------------------

I'm 48 years old and I'm *still* koding. Seriously, coding has been a life-saver for me. I grew up raised by a single immigrant mom on welfare and it's because of coding that I managed to build a career that I love. I hope that in 20 years when I'm 68, I'll still be able to say *PROUDLY* "I'm koding!" (and doing my 20th **Koding** global hackathon :)

Hi, I'm tonypai. Just graduate from school, this is my second global hackathon, the first one is nodejs knockout a.k.a. NKO, [Ninja Dart](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/lhc) is the work that time. This time I decided to attend on my own, hope have fun with you guys!

# What I'm going to do?

Game! Absolutey. Why? Because it's fun. What kind of it? Well, now it's just a thought, but I can tell you it's a co-op game. So, wait for it. :D

I'm a scientist (mainly with climate-related subjects) who has been writing code for research and 
outreach for many years. I am interested in numerical modeling and visualizations that help
make sense of the world in beautiful ways. 



Why I want to win
===================================
I have an idea about how to create more beautiful and interactive visualizations of global climate fields 
(like surface temperature) and I want to bring that idea into production for a large audience 
so they can see for themselves how the global climate has behaved, and that they can play with the data to draw their own conclusions from data.

Skills
============== 
- Javascript 
- HTML5 
- SVG 
- sed/awk/shell scripts etc
- NOAA/NASA APIs for the data

The idea
=======             
I'm going to tackle the climate question...by developing a better way to present public datasetes from 
NOAA and NASA.

I am an iOS developer.

##The Wunderbruders!

###About our team

We are two brothers originally from Brazil, but now both living in different parts of Germany.
Our love for games brought us across the ocean to work in the digital games industry!

#### Ziro Neto
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_500_500/p/1/005/07b/04b/2439215.jpg' alt='Ziro'/>


_Game Artist, Salsa Dancer, Latin Lover._


Starting in Brazil he has been exploring the world of game graphics in search of new exciting challenges.

His new quest brought him to work at MegaZebra in Munich, after having lived and worked in Recife, Helsinki, Berlin and Paris.
His amazing graphical skills will bring beauty to the project.

#### Edgar Neto
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/344513261577013834/a6291a2ad634f94a9b10a14c64335234_400x400.png' alt='Edgar'/>


_Programming Nerd, Coffee Drinker, Sleepy Dad._


Also from Recife, Brazil, this guy made his way to Berlin to start a new life with new challenges in the Old World.
Unlike his brother, he decided to set foot and stay in just one place.

He now works as an Objective-C developer at Memorado, making Brain Training games, but his hobby is to code Javascript and get other people excited about programming.


#### Lucy SPY
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgarjcfn/koding-spy/master/images/screenshot01.png' alt='Lucy'/>

_Groovy Spy, Funky girl, Digital Soul_

Lucy is the heart and soul to our project. With her funky moves and groovy spy abilities, she has the potential to bring the joy of programming to people who have little or no contact with coding.

She uses Python as her main weapon and she aims to eradicate the world from fear of programming (and recover some stolen diamonds while at it).

Even though she is a product of our imagination, and we've known her for only a weekend, she lives in both our hearts already.


#### The Project
During this weekend we have developed an HTML5 game to teach programming. We really put a lot of effort into character design, animations and sounds in order to make it a really awesome experience for people who don't yet know how to code.

We hope to encourage people to try their hands at Python and be introduced to the world of programming in an engaging and fun way.

We will continue the game as an open-source project after the Hackathon with the intent to make it an official [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/) tutorial. We hope to get a lot of support from the open-source community.
If next year, during the Hour of Code, thousands of people fall in love with Lucy and her groove, our mission is complete! :)


#### Special thanks
We'd like to thank the Koding team for inspiring us with this amazing theme. Being brothers working in the same industry we have been planning to make a game together for years but this was the first time we actually did it. This was an amazing weekend.

Thank you! :)
