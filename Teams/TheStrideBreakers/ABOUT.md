	Hello, we're The Stride Breakers. If you don't know, our name comes from the 1984 Matthew Wilder song, "Break My Stride". We're a devoted team of three and we know our stuff. Our strong points are in beautiful artistry and good execution of good ideas. Our artist, Nathan is a talented pixel artist and our two web devs, Ben and Bman (just go with it) are ready to tackle any tasks you throw at them. Our idea is a pixelated periodic table exploration game. When it is complete, it will help kids around the world learn about science.
