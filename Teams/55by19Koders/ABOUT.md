We are programmers working on our day jobs writing software,web apps, scripts,android apps et al. But there is something about
writing code that you really want to write, stuff that you try and build ( stuff that you dream off) in your free time.
This is what we would like to do, doing it in a time constraint environment, so as to have a minimum viable solution working
in quick time.

What are we going to do?

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We love data and how to visualise it, we live in a world
where increasingly we are collecting data for various purposes, right from selling adverts to doing health research. This hack weekend
gives us a great opportunity to play with various APIs and build something useful off them.

Why are we participating?

This is our first hackathon per see. We just want to have a blast trying to do stuff , that we really would like to do. Period!
