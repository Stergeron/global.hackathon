# Lambda Ninja
I'm Hasan, a computer hacker from Egypt. 

## About

I programmed in many languages before. I really do love the idea of funcational programming
and it has managed to creep its way into my C programming.. Eek!

For prototyping I use processing, arduino and python. Since this is a hackathon, something tells
me I'll be coding in processing this hackathon!

## Quick overview of idea
A game written in processing accompanied by teaching material and good documentation.

The learning theme, simply put.

Okay, that wasn't too revealing :D Happy hacking!
