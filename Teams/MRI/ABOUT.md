My Story
==============
My name is Loqman Hakimi. I'm software and web developer from Iran.

The reason I want to participate in this competetion is like any other person that wants
to be a part of this hackaton "To Compete" and also the money :) .

Here is my profile picture:

My Skills
=====
I love coding in Ruby and using Rails to develop web applications.
and also like coding in javascript and using Node.js and Socket.io for realtime web
applications.

For front-end development Bootstrap and Font-Awesome are my choices.

As the theme of this hacketon is problems faceing the earth, and as I recently watched on the "Last Week Tonighy with John Oliver"'s episode about global warming and some people still don't believe in it, I would like to create an app to visualize this fact.
