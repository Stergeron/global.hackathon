My team
===========================
This is my one man "team". I am young boy from a small town from small country. The moment I got my first computer,
I started spending hours finding new things about it. And my interest was growing and by the time was in High School,
I went into the more "serious part". For now I am interested in Web Development, but who knows what the future holds?

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I have knowledge of HTML5, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, JavaScript, NodeJS, AngularJS and CSS(but it's not my thing).
