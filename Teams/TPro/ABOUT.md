On the very first sight we are ordinary team with team lead and coders. On the other hand each of us is "The One". 
We are personalities with high ambitions, self-motivation and professional background.

We are participating in Hackathon to prove ourselves, get great non-stop-Koding experience and to get fun (Koding is funny, isn't it?).


"Wazzap"
=======
Like most of checked-in teams we are "still brainstormin". We are going to use up-to-date technologies. 
At this moment, seems that we will use PHP/node.js + MySQL/Mongo (maybe hybrid), Angular.js, DataDog API, nginx for server and some of provided APIs (we are not sure yet).


Best wishes
===========
We are wishing all the luck to all participients (ofcourse we have it already taken). Let the Koding begin! :)
