We've worked together for around 3 years, and between us we have over ten years of webdev experience.

Whether it be our own startup or one of the many freelance projects we've completed together, we've always prided ourselves on pushing boundaries and doing new things. So when we heard about the Koding Hackathon, and saw the themes, we jumped right on to the idea.

We can't wait to show everyone our idea.

Goal

We plan to create a real time chat application with a very unique twist, keep an eye out!
