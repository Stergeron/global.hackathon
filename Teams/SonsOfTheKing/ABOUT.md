The reason we joined this hackathon was to have a fun way to put our programming/problem solving skills to the test.

Josh and I both have a way of thinking about everything we encounter anything that causes problems or isn't efficient, how
can we fix this? It's this motivation that drives the majority of our projects, the rest of them fall along the lines of, 
"How can we turn this microwave into something useful other than cooking hot pockets?" Either way, it's our passion to make
things that can benefit people in whatever they are doing, making technology work for us, not the other way around.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We tend to work better with html 5 and jQuery, our project will probably 
revolve around web technologies including PHP for our server side code. So
the educational multiplayer game sounds like a likely option for our theme choice.
