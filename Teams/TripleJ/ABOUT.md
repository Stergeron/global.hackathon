# Introducing <a href="#"><img src="http://www.designledge.com/clients/codefeud/logo.jpg" alt="codeFeud"></a>
<a href="#">codeFeud</a> is a multiplayer HTML5 game designed to teach programming to both beginner and advanced developers using the “learning by doing” teaching methodology. Specifically, players compete against each other by solving simple, intermediate, or complex programming questions within a predetermined timeframe. The player with the fastest and smallest solution to the problem wins the round and advances on a digital game board. The first player to reach 10 on the game board wins the “feud” and increases their rating for future matches.

# The TripleJ team
Jørgen, Jacob, and James (TripleJ) came together for 48 hours to dream up, design, and develop codeFeud with a vision of inspiring more people to code in a fun and engaging way. That and the prize money, bragging rights, and recognition was pretty sweet.

Jørgen from Norway:   Font and back end developer / project lead<br>
Jacob from Russia:    Back end developer / database mastermind<br>
James from USA:       Designer and front end developer / obsessive detailer<br>
