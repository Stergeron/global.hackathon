Hi! I'm an individual developer, excited to participate in the Hackathon.

## About Me

My name is Anton, you can also call me Antonio. I didn't think much about team name, it got to be just my name:).
I'm a PHP developer, also good in JavaScript. For backend I'm using PHP framework called Yii 2. This powerful thing 
leads PHP on completely different level.
And of course I like frontend too, so I got to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially jQuery, an 
awesome JavaScript library.

Looking forward when the koding battle begins... And let the strongest to win!

## Languages and tools I like

-- [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) v2.0 (based on PHP)  
-- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (based on JavaScript)  
-- HTML 5, CSS 3  
-- DBMS: MySQL or [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.org/)  
-- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) (honestly didn't use, but want to try (!) )  

-- and Java (I know it is completely different from PHP, but since I tried it, I really liked it. Although I'm not going 
to use it for the Hackathon, because don't have enough XP for that.)

## About my project

Most of all I want my project to be really useful for people. It is a primary purpose, because if it becomes useful, it is 
always possible to make it awesome.
