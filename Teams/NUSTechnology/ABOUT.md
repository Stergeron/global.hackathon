About our team
===========================
We are a group of young and passionate Web developers in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We are all interested in developing web application using cutting-edge technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap. Our main framework for developing application would be in Ruby on Rails as we have been using it daily for several years.

This contest is a great opportunity for us to test our limits and bring our skills to a new level. We also want to show to the world what we can do to help solve problems we are facing each day. It is all about ideas and how to turn those ideas into reality, and we want to be part of it.
