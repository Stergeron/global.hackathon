<h1>We are Corey, Caleb, Daniel, Chris and Together we make up Float-Center</h1>

<p>Our team is located in Wichita, Kansas, and no we do not live on a farm, ride horses to work or have a dog name Toto. We will however claim Superman as an honorary Jayhawker because he is awesome:</p>

<p>We are front end developers who love kittens, most of us at least. I personally hate the little bastards. With joking aside, we are a group of skilled front end developers who are excited to see what we can do during the given 48 hours.</p>

<h2>What are we trying to accomplish</h2>
<p>Here in the Midwest we have been suffering from a drought for several years now.  This drought has dramatically impacted farming and has now started to change our long term outlook for drinkable water. This is a relatively new concern for us but around the world water scarcity is a large problem. <br />
<br />
We decided to create a website that would to address theme #1:</p>
<ol>
  <il>Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. (e.g. climate change, earthquakes, food/water waste, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>And the focus on comprehensive data of water related issues in the world.</p>
<p>Love Always,<br />
