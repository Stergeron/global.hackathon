We are self-taught developers that love to learn new things, especially things that matter in a social context. Our main goal has been to contribute to change the way we treat education in our culture. We share some feelings about formal education and how it should encourage students to care about the society when learning a profession instead to just getting certification. Innovation is something that needs to cover the way we relate to others.
