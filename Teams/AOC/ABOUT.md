we don't have time to join, we have a physics midterm on saturday and a never-ending history project that haunts us
and I suspect it will break the bonds of our friendships. so that's why we decided to join.

we all have it in our hearts to program something. we've all been this way when we met at the ORPHANAGE in Ankara,
we all studied very hard, putting aside coding, to go to university and just as when we were thinking we'll be having
a good time, we are doomed to do homework and all. 


we are incredibly skillful young fellows.

we're into applications.
