GranaHack
================

GranaHack is a team from Granada, Spain, coordinated from the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es) by the [Free Software Office](http://osl.ugr.es)

===========================

From the [OSL](http://github.com/oslugr) we would like to boost the development of free software in the city (and the university) and to have fun while programming. There is a great pool of students, researchers and hackers and we would like to beat up the bushes a bit to know who's there and create, in the future, bigger projects.
