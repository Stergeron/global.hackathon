After working together in a corporate market research company we've since gone our separate ways. This is an opportunity for us to get the team back together, test our skills and hopefully make the world a better place along the way.


About your skills and what you are going to do?

We're all full stack C#/.NET developers, although we're most likely going to be using a NodeJS backend. We've a fair amount of experience with data visualisation so you may see something from us there, although we all love to learn so watch this space.
