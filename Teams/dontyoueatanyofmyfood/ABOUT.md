Deditcatedly we searched for something that represents our deepes desires and gifts us a frown.
After months of searching we accidentaly found a vid on youtube that fullfills our craving.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJTagg3Z7Rs) is the video I'm talking about.
Our inspiration and muse.

We are a team of students from the Br√ºhlwiesen School. Our main focus is technology and math.
Marvin is our Lead Designer. Chris and I mainly work at backend stuff. We thought that competing in a competition would be fun and gives us some great experiences. In school we are working almost everyday on team projects. We know how teamplay works and thought a competiton like this could bring us to a new level. Also we are really excited to meet people from all over the world.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
