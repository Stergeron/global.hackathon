Currently, I'm a student of Electrical Engineering, who's interested in computer programming. I've participated in a number of programming contests before, and 3 or 4 hackathons. In a hackathon held in our school, our team even scored the first. I have almost no experience doing serious web design, but I've spent enough time messing up with sources and APIs I think I *can* do something. 

Talking about the hackathon, living in Iran *and* Tehran, I can't be indifferent about environmental issues. A number of major Iranian lakes and rivers are drying, which result in many problems, including but not limited to damages to agriculture, damages to animal and plant life, decrease in already-rare water resources, dust rising from those dried lakes, which is already becoming a problem, and... To make it all worse, Tehran is already running out of water resources, which means that the tap water might become unsafe to drink. 

Concidering all these, I decided to do a project which would help solve (or reduce the magnitude of) these problems. I'll also learn to work with github, learn more web design, and have a good time participating in a hackathon at 3 AM :)
