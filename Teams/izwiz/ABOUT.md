I am a young developer who was inspired by a robotics team in his highschool to work in the software development field. So far, I've worked over 3 years in internships and 3 hackathons with success.

I want to win this competition because I want to prove to myself that all my hard work of learning programming and development has paid off and that I can compete on a professional level. This field is hard and demanding and even though I may not have had the most technologically enriching environment growing up, my gusto and ingenuity will be my keys to victory.

My Project - Babylon
===========================

This project is going to be a step up from the Star Trek Universal Translator.
