The Project
===========================
Our project is called "Treehuggers" and it is an educational HTML5 multiplayer game about air pollution. You and your friends must plant trees in order to reduce the pollution caused by the factory in the middle of the island. You have a limited number of initial trees and unlock more by correctly answering questions about the environment.
