I have been developing websites and web applications for 12 years. I am currently developing and coordinating development of Enterprise applications and services.
From a technical point of view, I have a great understanding and knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns, integration mechanisms and communication formats. I have worked with a number of different languages on different platforms. I'm currently interested in and developing Cloud and BigData-based solutions.
I love Linux (specifically Debian, Ubuntu and Android) and I use it everyday, both on the desktop and on the server.
I also love being creative and developing all kinds of stuff.
