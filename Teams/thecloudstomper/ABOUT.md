I'm 48 years old and I'm *still* koding. Seriously, coding has been a life-saver for me. I grew up raised by a single immigrant mom on welfare and it's because of coding that I managed to build a career that I love. I hope that in 20 years when I'm 68, I'll still be able to say *PROUDLY* "I'm koding!" (and doing my 20th **Koding** global hackathon :)
