This is our page (seriously!)
=============================

We are freelancers, college friends and really new to the concept of Hackathons!

What we love? Food, Drinks, Mobiles (who doesn't?), memes (yes we're above 18, but who cares?), and to code (this is not the last priority, it just looks cool to be in the end, leaves an effect)

Wondering about the team name? Well you should, the story is very nostalgic for every Indian being brought up to our age *drum rolls*

Team Shaktiman is all about nostalgia, Shaktiman being the 1st Indian Superhero 
will live forever in our hearts and that is what we'll be aiming at, to recreate
nostalgia.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Well we're freelancers! We fix day to day glitches, create cool stuff, we're currently working on something very cool btw (not ready though, but that's for another day).
Our skills include eating while sitting on the couch, drinking while watching TV and 
work our ass off to get what we want.

What you can expect from us? "Well, you'll be pleasently surprised"
