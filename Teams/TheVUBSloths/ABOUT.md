Briefly describe your team
==========================
We are friends that like to code together. This year we graduated together in computer science at the Free University of Brussels. Surely, this Hackaton will be much fun but we are here also for new skills and experience. 
Oh almost forgotten.. we love beer.



What are your skills?
=====================
First of all, we are computer scientist. So we know a little bit of a lot of things. On the other hand, we are graduates, so we don't know anything. Web development for the win!
