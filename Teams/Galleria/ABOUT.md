# Galleria

Galeria (*gallery* in english, the two "L" in the team name it's a bad practice of *how to make a name cool*) it's a place to show things, like paintings.

# About Marcos SF Filho - Team Leader

The idea that anything can be made in a "virtual space" fascinates me above everything. If someone challenges you to program something, you can.

I'm young, 19-years old. Know a bunch of things, like PHP, Java, Ruby, Web development, games development, but I'm not a specialist in any of these.

Born in Brazil, and still living in Brazil.
