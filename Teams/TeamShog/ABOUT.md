### "Chris" (PEMapModder) ![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/x2aQ9K7.png?1)
"Chris" is a nickname of a person whose real name is not wishes to be known. He hates waiting for the OS or websites to respond and loves doing small jobs by writing a PHP script to do them instead, or to memorize long boring URLs. He is also interested in Java applications, although he often ends up creating manyf classes instead. Most of his work stays at his brain, sometimes written on a school notebook. However, he has very few products released as he hates testing.
