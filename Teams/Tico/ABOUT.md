Hi, I'm a web developer from Costa Rica. I love what I do. So much that I even like to do it for free.
Prizes are good too but I just want to participate and have a great time.

About My Team
================

I am the team, for now. I hope that changes in the next few days.

About The Project
================

Project idea is sill very much in the air, but I can say for sure that its going to be a web app built on PHP (Laravel 4 framework) using jQuery for the client logic and MySQL for the database.
