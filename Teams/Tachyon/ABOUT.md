Team Tachyon
============
---
Why Tachyon you may ask? Well, a tachyon is a theoretical particle that travels faster than the speed of light. In ~~fact~~(theory), if someone threw a tachyonic ball at you, you would be hit before you even saw the ball hitting you. This 'faster than speed of light' will relate to my project theme below.

Hey! I'm a high school student who loves to learn Computer Scince. I've been learning about computers and the web ever since elementary school. Starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to programming languages in middle school such as PHP, and Visual Basic. Now in high school, I have mastered PHP and Java. I have visited Googleplex after becoming the Grand Prize Winner in Google Code-In 2013, the first ever programming contest I participated in. 

I've always wanted to attend a Hackathon, but due to the lack of Hackathons near me, and the long distance I would need to travel, this wasn't possible. When I first heard the news that there was going to be a global hackathon, I was more than thrilled to participate. This will be my first Hackathon, and I am very excited to be taking part in the first global Hackathon!


Skills / Plans
==============
I am interested in theme 5, challenges associated with real time communication and translation. Although PHP is my best language, I will try to use Node.js to solve this problem as you can have real-time direct connections with the server and the client using socket.io. Also, this 'real-time' communication might just be ... faster than the speed of light.
