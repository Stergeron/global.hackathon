We are a team of developers and hackathon lovers.

We have been waiting for this competition for a long time and each of us have a specific reason to be here, but if there is one word that can describe what we are hoping to find here is: Opportunity.

Opportunity to work together in something new and exciting. Opportunity to have fun in this fast paced life. And opportunity to win something that can really make a difference in our future carriers!




Two of us are really good with front-end development, but node.js is here and we have been building awesome things with it. The other one is a rails ninja and have been asked to work in tons of nice companies (but he really likes his own company).
