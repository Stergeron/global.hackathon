**Dan**: Code junkie and coffee lover building web apps and living the startup life.

**Christian**: I design. I draw. I write.

Both transplanted from larger tech and design markets and out to prove that small town can make an impact.

=======
- Use equal parts of each Node.js, UX and Design
- Add APIs, JavaScript, and styling to taste
- Stir continuously for up to 24 hours -- make sure to simmer for remaining time
