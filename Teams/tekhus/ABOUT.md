I enjoy coding, especially when it involves doing something more creative than the norm. The challenge of doing so in a contest atmosphere seemed like it might be a lot of fun, and the themes make it even more interesting. I'm really looking forward to participating - I had hoped my teammates would have been able to join me this weekend to make it even more fun, but even on my own is still going to be rewarding and enjoyable.


About your skills and what you are going to do?

I'm aiming to do something interactive, fun, and educational, at the very least probably using jQuery. Eveything else will probably be decided on the fly!
