================

I love studying, programming, freelancing and finding out about new technologies.
I am not an first hander developer. I like waiting for things to get mature before jumping in and dedicating hours.

I am just a developer trying to make a difference. I quit college in the last year to study what I want to study.
The picture you see is me when I was 19 after serving the army here in Brazil. Why did I serve? Just for the sake of it.
I wanted to loose some weight and get paid to do so, at least, that was how I was looking at it. 
Turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life and I am fucking proud of it.

I was born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, my parents managed to move out from Rio to Curitiba, where I currently live in.
Here I managed to get a great education, entered one of the best public schools and got a 100% schollarship from the government and started studying Computer Science at the Catholic University.

I am proud of my achievements but, as I you can see, I am facing this single handed. Why? Because I can't find people that are commited as I am.

I have great friends, don't get me wrong, but none of them is into programming. So, it's just me again facing challenges. 
Hahaha
