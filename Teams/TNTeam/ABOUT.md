## Who we are

TNTeam consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
met at workplace (Rafik, Ibtissem and Marwa happen to be coworkers,
Elyes was an intern in that same company work in) or while attending
Kendo training (Rafik and Chakib are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam
is made of close friends, that all love hacking and fine arts.

* `Rafik` and `Ibtissem` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably write lots of Javascript(On the
browser, and servside as Node.js) even if
they originally love Clojure. They will also join Front-end side if
they have to, but only if there is no other choice.
* `Marwa` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS. She
accouns for three years experience.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps. He will learn a 2D JS Game framework for
this contest.
* `Chakib` is the artist of the team. He will create unique and
  amazing artwork for our project. He actually created our Crest,
  "Freddy Yeah", wearing a traditional Tunisian "Chachia" - a fancy hat.

TNTeam already entered
[Clojure Cup 2014](https://clojurecup.com/#/people/teams), and ended
up third by public votes. So Close!

Here's what we all look like:

## So what are we cooking for you?

TNTeam fell in love with theme 4, which is about designing educational
html5 multiplayer game.

We'll be designing a HTML5 multiplayer strategy/action game to educate
and raise awareness about online privacy and security issues. We'll
try to show, by the means of a small wargame-like, how are people facing
various caveats regarding the ownership of material they share on
social networks, the security and confidentiality of their
communications, the tracing they are submitted when browsing, the
threats of theft of their sensitive data...

## Technologies

To be able to produce the game, we'll (most likely) use a bunch of technologies:

- Web Server : nginx, httpkit (for services and websocket), probably
  some of Node.js facilities.

- Back end Platform: probably Node.js (Maybe using clojurescript),
  with underscore.js, to get advantage from the ease of socket.io,
  maybe some Clojure / Java8 for some other parts.

- Data Store : mongodb or Redis

- Front End : Phaser.io as a HTML5 game engine.

We'll be hosted at a local coworking space,
[Cogite](https://www.facebook.com/Cogite.Coworking.Space). These guys
were awesome enough to allow us to meet and enter the hackathon in
their premices!
Also, we'll be retreating at our mother company,
[appsnsites](https://www.appsnsites.com), but no ads here.
