Hi, i'm **Pulpo**, and i am proud to present my solo team 'Octomouse'. 
Octomouse comes from octopus (me) and mouses because two friends _(Pinky and The Brain)_ were going to join me, but they were too busy trying to conquer the world so they couldn't actually join.

**It is my very first time in a hackathon!** I am very exited about the experience!

Follow my team on twitter! I'm posting updates every now and then! https://twitter.com/phk_nevermore

My name is Germán, I'm 25 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am coding since i was 14. 8 years doing that professionally.
My favorite things in the computer world are coding, hacking arround with Linux machines, and gaming to relax my mind.
I joined this hackaton because i love challenges and i want to do something fun an exciting.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

In my history as a software developer, i jumped across many jobs, different languages, technologies, frameworks and methodology.
My strongs are PHP, Java, Linux, and rubber duck debugging. I suck at front-end, REALLY. I don't have the patience to reload a page four hundred times to get it to look as i like.

The voice that reads very fast legal disclamers in Argentinian radio ads has inspired me to make a fine print fast-reader.
Since i've been left alone, i don't expect to get something big, but anyway i'm gonna have a fun time coding.
I don't care if i dont win, in fact, i'm sure my solution will be unfinished and totally unpolished by the end of the hackathon. 
I just hope I can share a cool idea with the world, and make somethig useful from this.

_Thanks for reading, and good luck to all the teams!_
