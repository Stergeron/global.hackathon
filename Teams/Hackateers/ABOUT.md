## Introducing The Hackateers

We are a group of three hackers hailing from [Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar](http://qatar.cmu.edu).
Two of us are graduates and one is currently a student.
Our members have previously participated in hackathons and even helped organize, mentor, or judge a hackathon or two.
We decided to join this hackathon to combine the different skills and experiences we gathered throughout the different paths we have embarked on to hack on something of great.


## About the team

  - **Ossama Obeid:** I am a research associate working in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have previously co-founded a company working on iOS apps for local clients. My interests include hacking software and hardware, painting, and reading up on Physics, Psychology, and History. Aiming to be a Renaissance man :)

  - **Afnan Fahim:** Hacker for all things front-end and aspiring new media artist. Side hobbies include learning languages. I envision a day when I will be able to travel to any country and communicate kinda sorta effectively.

  - **Mahmoud Alismail:** I am a CS junior at CMU. I enjoy working on computer vision applications and backend development. I like to use Django, Node, and OpenCV on my backends. In my free time, I tend to hack RGB+D cameras as well as highly scalable web applications.


## What are we doing?
Our idea is not solid yet but we will be writing a web app using Python for our back-end and HTML, JS, and CSS for our front-end.
We will be possibly utilizing NLP technologies and APIs such as NLTK, wit.ai, or IBM Watson.
