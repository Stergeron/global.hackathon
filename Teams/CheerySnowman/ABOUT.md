## About

I'm a .NET developer from Yekaterinburg (it's in Russia) making people happy with my programs.

Love clear and well-designed code. Have some machine learning and data structures background.

## Languages I love

I have been trying out many popular languages (Java and C++, Scheme and F#, python and perl, ...) and I am comfortable with C#, T-SQL and R currently.
