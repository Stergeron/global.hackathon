Dear Judges,

I am 17 years old and have only been coding for about a year. I know some HTML/CSS/JS and that is all. I though a hackathon would be cool with my friend. He did not have time to do it with me because of finals, and I admit I have no idea how to use Koding on my own. So here is my idea, although it is not built yet. I hope I can truly participate in your hackathon next year.

Sincerely,

Isaac Rowe
