We are a team of developers who are passionate about web technologies and programming. We mainly use the Laravel PHP framework, which enables us to enjoy modern application development to the most. Agile, TDD and OOP are important to us, however we don't mind prototyping and hacking ideas together with a goal to get something up and running asap too (when quick results outweigh the cost of good development practices: eg a global hackathon).
