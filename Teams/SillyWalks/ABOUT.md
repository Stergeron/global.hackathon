The Department of Silly Walks
=============================

We are team Silly Walks, a small team of programmers passionate about Python
and data from the Philippines.

We aim to visualize disaster recovery efforts starting from the most recent
typhoon that hit our nation, typhoon "Yolanda", internationally known as
"Haiyan".

The hope is to bring about awareness and information about these disasters,
i.e. how much was the cost of damage to people and infrastructure, foreign and
local aids, etc.

In this effect, we are addressing problem set 1.
