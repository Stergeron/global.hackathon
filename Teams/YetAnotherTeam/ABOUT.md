Yet Another Team
================
Hello hackers/koders!

As you might have noticed by now, this team is called "Yet Another Team" (yes, not the most creative name).

About the team
--------------
This is a "single-member" team.

Just like you probably are, I am just another enthusiast, who believes that he can contribute (even in a small way), to a better world.

The name is inspired by the Linux community, which widely uses the "YA" acronym.
I highly admire this community, that is well-known for providing clever ideas, often in an altruistic way.

Although winning one of the categories would be very nice, this is not what drives me to join this contest.
It is the idea that I can contribute to help people, in some way, what drives me.

About my skills and purpose
---------------------------
I currently work as a Technical Support agent for a partner of a well-known network corporation.

It is my hobby to program (in various languages, including PHP, JavaScript, Java and C++).
My dream is to become a good programmer, for this is what I enjoy the most.

I consider myself a hacker, since I like to customize things to work better for me.

I would like to address the need for a better way to deliver legal documents (EULA, TOS), although I cannot provide a lot of details, at the time.
