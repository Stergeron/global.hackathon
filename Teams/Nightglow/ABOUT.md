About me
--------
Hello everybody, my name is Stefan Blamberg, I am a 17-year-old hobby developer from Germany.
This is my first hackathon and I am quite unexperienced but nevertheless I hope I will have a lot of fun.

I started developing games about 1 year ago and I have already won one competition by Mozilla and Goo technologies.
