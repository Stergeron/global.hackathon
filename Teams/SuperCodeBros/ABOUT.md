Super Code Bros
================
***We are the Super Code Bros., young code monkeys from the cold land of bountiful fjords, Norway!***  

Our prototype for the game we hope to develop further after this is over: [hansrodtang.koding.io](http://hansrodtang.koding.io)

We are two interaction design/computer science students from Oslo, Hans and Nicolai.

---


**Hans** is currently studying Interaction Design at the University of Oslo. He is originally from Iceland but moved to Norway at a young age where he has lived since. He is an active photographer when not busy with school.
He also enjoys long walks on the beach, candelit dinners and knitting, and practicing pastafarianism.

He coded from a young age with copy-pasting and mixing Javascript snippets on his website made in Frontpage 2000, then did some Visual Basic 6, GameMaker 6 and PHP. He tried to forget that time of his life by drinking copious amounts of Aquavit. He has since then gotten his life together and now develops in a multitude of technologies, for the moment he has a soft spot for Go.

Nicolai is at the time being studied at the University of Oslo. ..or was it the other way around?
He is a guitarist in a [big band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band) called Big Boss Band.
He lives in a party mansion, also commonly known as "Mom and Dad's Basement".
He is afraid of the dark, and exceptions in PHP.

**Nicolai** got a flying start with tutorials from W3Schools (A Norwegian site, actually  :no_mouth: , for which we sincerely apologize on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway™ for letting in to this world).

He once developed a CMS targeted towards the elderly to help them manage an event planning site on their own. He is passionate about interaction and user experience and thinks the most important facet of any application is an intuitive interface.  
His graphic design skills can be considered lacklustre, but he compensates with his capabilities as a programmer and makes designs come to life with great care.

We love hackathons. Being given the option to creatively and emotionally unfold and unleash the Codebro within, is the best thing in the world (except pure norwegian kebabs). 

Skills and Plans
================
Hans has experience in Go, Python, C, Javascript and loads of tools and libraries for them. He is also capable of designing and creating great and simple user interfaces and interactions for web, desktop and mobile applications.

Nicolai has for the most part worked with web development and the languages and technologies that accompany that field.
That means Javascript for the most part, but also Go and Python. On his spare time he enjoys exercising his brain with languages like Scheme, Standard ML, Scala and Prolog.

Fun fact: The blue cap on Nicolai's image is actually red (read: Mario color) but was Photoshop™-ed by his horrible, horrible ex.

We plan to try our hand at an multiplayer educational game using React for interface and Canvas/WebGL. Backend will be written in Go, and we want to try out WebRTC for P2P communication if we get the time.
