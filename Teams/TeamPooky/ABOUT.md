#Team Pooky

It's more than just great that you came up with this Virtual hackathon idea ... because, this may come as a surprise (or not):

###In Slovenia, hackathons don't exist. 

There are no hackathons. Yet. If you want to join one, you have to travel. Once a member of Team Pooky drove to Berlin (that's 1000 km) just for a hackathon. There are computer science oriented events and hackerspaces and good enthusiastic programmers, but - really - no hackathons. Yet.

So you see, we almost _have to_ win - to get the attention to help us start organizing hackathons in Slovenia.

##The Plan

Languages we'll use: that depends on the idea we'll come up with. For now it looks like it's a HTML5 game, games are fun, but it will be educational as well ... a lot can happen in 48 hours :)
