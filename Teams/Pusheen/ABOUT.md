## What we want to do
- We aim to do the fifth theme ( Challenges associated with real time communication and translation )
- Since it is a real-time web app, we think PubHub's api may help. And we will also use the google api to process the audio.
- The first application we thought about this theme is a chat room. However, it's kind of boring if it's only able to do communication and translation. Therefore, we want to build it as a game. Users not only communicate, but also attack others with the cannonball formed with translated words. Users will understand the meaning of others' responses, so we think the dialog won't become impolite. The length of sentences in competitor's language and the time of attack may affect the result. We think the users will need some time to find out the strategy to win, so in our opinion, it will be a BRUTAL game!!!
