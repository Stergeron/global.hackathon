We are <b>Insomnia</b>
...a group of four coders from different parts of the world.

We might be small as a team, but our will is great and lack of sleep can't bother us.


About your team
===========================

We are composed of four members, scattered across the world, who just recently met and banded for Koding's Hackathon. We also want to have fun and learn while coding and attempting to solve problems.

<b>Roman Redkovich</b>

I'm nerd, non-stopable learner, who has took oppurtunity of online education rise and dived into courses from lead world universities to push knowlege further. Work as back-end developer, Linux system administrator at current time, have some pet projects on automotive statistics also love electronic and microcontroller stuff.

<b>Arvin Joseff Tan</b>

As a programmer, I've just been serious within the last year. I've taken courses on basic computer science and have had experience coding GUI game apps. At the moment, I only know Python and C++ but plan to expand this skillset while learning new experiences. I've also been wanting to work with everyone from all around the world. This Hackathon is the start of all of these! 

<b>Petra Stručić</b>

I'm a beginner programer and has hope to take new experience at Koding hackathon.

<b>Fakhrizal Leksa</b>

As a Front End guy, mostly i'm working as a freelancer. In the last 4 years do tech stuff and brainstorming in some local startup. I dropped out of college 7 years ago -taking majoring in Mining Engineering, pursuing my interest in journalism, new media and codes. But then i took it this interest seriously, especially in to programming and new media. I do some design, user experience to the codes for news website and apps. And this time love to explore data mining and open data.
