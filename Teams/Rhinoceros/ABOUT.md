I am a recent graduate of [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/), working at a independent game development company called [Taleworlds Entertainment]. (https://www.taleworlds.com/) Even though I am really interested in the idea, I was not able to participate in more than a couple of hackathons, usually due to the location of most of them being too remote to participate. This one being online is yet another reason that got me excited.

Assignments at school or work may be exciting or educational, but the spontaneity of creativity encouraged in hackathons help get the experience of developing to a whole new level.

I don't think my goal is to win. Rather, it is to produce something that I, and hopefully others as well, would like to make use of.


About our skills and what we are going to do?

The TOS and EULA are one tough nut to crack, but it sure would be fun to tackle it as a weekend project. Any attempt to simplify understanding their coverage would surely require working on the front-end, which would make the implementation part an experimental endeavor to me, as I am more used to working in the back-end. I am still going through the wondrous APIs encouraged, though, and I may end up implementing something based on one (or a few) or them.
