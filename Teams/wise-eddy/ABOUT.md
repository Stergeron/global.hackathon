I'm a scientist (mainly with climate-related subjects) who has been writing code for research and 
outreach for many years. I am interested in numerical modeling and visualizations that help
make sense of the world in beautiful ways. 



Why I want to win
===================================
I have an idea about how to create more beautiful and interactive visualizations of global climate fields 
(like surface temperature) and I want to bring that idea into production for a large audience 
so they can see for themselves how the global climate has behaved, and that they can play with the data to draw their own conclusions from data.

Skills
============== 
- Javascript 
- HTML5 
- SVG 
- sed/awk/shell scripts etc
- NOAA/NASA APIs for the data

The idea
=======             
I'm going to tackle the climate question...by developing a better way to present public datasetes from 
NOAA and NASA.
