# Echoes

We are a team from Croatia. Between us we have over 10 years of experience in web development. We all enjoy a good challenge, but we have never worked as a team. This will be an opportunity for us to see what we can create together.

## Our story

Each of us has a story to tell. But as a team, our story is very short and simple:

> One of us saw the info about this hackaton and thought "why not?"  
> The others agreed.
>  
> To be continued...
  
We like useful things, so that's what we hope to create here - a useful tool.
