We are friends looking for an excuse to build something for fun and for a purpose. Instead of procrastinating, we decided to make something happen with this hackathon!


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We want to experiment with new languages such as GO but is now the time? Otherwise, node.js or phython.

We are brainstorming projects for theme 2 & 3
