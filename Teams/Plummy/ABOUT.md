Welcome to Plummy
================

We are the Plummy team, so we are participating.
That's not it, well yeah, we are team in both real world and this koding event. We are doing many projects as a startup currently. All of our team are Indonesian, but one of our team currently living in Melbourne.
We always work remotely and this event is our chance to do some work together and train our work team (and conquer the world).
This is our double live. To live as a coder, die as a legend.

Sounds Plummy :)
