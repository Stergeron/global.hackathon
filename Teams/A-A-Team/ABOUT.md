We are the hackaton newbies Alton and Adrienne (A&A) and we are so excited for our first hackaton experience! With a small team consisting of just two members, we push ourselves to work as efficiently as possible. Our goal is to learn as much as possible while having a great time. We are so excited to sit infront of a computer for 48 hours going through what Adrienne calls a roller coaster ride; Excitiment from working code and fustration from errors and bugs.

Alton

I'm Alton and I love coding. I am an engineering student at the University of Waterloo following my dreams to learn more about computers. I have prior experience in Python, Turing, C#, SQL, as well as PHP and more expertise in Java, Java-Android, Objective C, HTML, and CSS. I am currently learning Javascript to complement my knowledge in HTML and CSS for this hackaton. Besides coding, I am an avid swimmer and I also like to tell really lame jokes. What's brown and sticky? Hint: It's not what you think it is.  

By the way, life is like a mushroom.


Adrienne

Hi, I'm Adrienne! I am relatively new to programming and looking forward to an awesome learning experience through the global hackaton, with the help of my team leader and super awesome coder, Alton! Inspired by him, I started to learn programming about a year ago. I now have some basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, C++, and MATLAB. Because of my grown appreciation for programming, I am now a transfer student in Systems Design Engineering at the Univesrity of Waterloo where I learn how to encoroprate design aspects in all my projects. Besides programming, I LOVE TO DANCE! If you don't see me studying or coding, then I'm either in a studio or on stage dancing! The above picture of me was take from a show back in 2013 broadcasted on Fairchild TV. 

Code. Dance. Love. Live. 




Languages We Love 
===========================

<p>EVERYTHING! :) </p>
<p> We hope to learn as much as we can, no matter what language. We would learn everything if we can! </p>
