Project
================

During the hackathon we intend to develop a project focused on handling such a global problem as psychiatric illnesses.

**Why mental disorders make a global challenge?**

Statistically as many as 20-25% global population suffer this or that mental disease.

Meanwhile this statistics ignores the influence of psychiatric disorders of the sick on their families. It does not take into account the effect on the global economy either (covering expenses for hospital admissions, unemployment, disability allowances, unplanned vacations, etc.). But the latter turns this problem into the most  important one for the mankind.

**Which goals does our project pursue?**

We set two mutually important aims:

**1)**	To collect the information on the illnesses dynamics and various factors influence for further studies and treatment adjustment.

**2)**	To ease as much as possible patients’ sufferings by raising control over the disorder.

**How can our project tackle the problem?**

We are going to develop a system for collecting information about patients’ condition and forwarding the data gathered to doctors, psychologists, therapists, self-aid groups and researchers. 

**Why has our team picked up this topic and why are we confident in our project success?**

The idea for our project was born by our team member Olymzhon Iuldashov who personally had gone through alarm, panic attacks, depersonalization, derealization, depression, psychosis, euphoria, delusion, paraphrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Having but a very close experience of a close friend’s disease our team is aware of how important IT decisions are for mental patients and we know the way to deal with this global challenge

How did we hacked during the hackathon?
-----------

First at all we choosed a place where we were able to work together. This place for us was Danila's flat, where we had spent all 48 hours of Hackathon.

Then we did some preparation before the Hackathon start - install web-server, create GitHub repo and some planning work.

So, we used Trello to store our tasks and plans, shared our code between team members with GitHub and off course we had used the real-time communication.

The result of this 48-hours hacking session is here: [http://kapidarium.com/](http://kapidarium.com)

**Tools that we had used in our project:**

1. **Yii2** for backend (API).
2. **backbone.js** and some dirty hacks with **jQuery** ;) on frontend.
3. **composer** for PHP packages
4. **Nginx** web server
5. **php-fpm**
6. **MySQL**
7. **phing** to build our application on server
8. **Redis** 
9. Amazing **Koding VM** as production server.
