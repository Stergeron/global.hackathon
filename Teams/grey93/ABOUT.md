Not really a team, just me, a random undergrad at IIT Roorkee.

I am currently an undergraduate student in my pre-final year studying Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

In my spare time, I like to do web and mobile application development using cross platform JavaScript tools. 

See my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/grey93) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/_grey93) profile for more.


Submission
=======

I have built an app under the theme
> HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented. (multiplayer preferred)

My game idea is a simple yet fun addition game called [**proximus**](http://ugkkaf048439.grey93.koding.io/) 
that allows young children to understand the fundamentals of addition, while at the same time having fun.
However, addition isn't the only component involved here, it's also brainy as hell, so adults can have fun too.
The Application was built on [node.js](https://nodejs.org) using the [express](http://expressjs.com) web server.
It is a clone of the popular flash game ***proximity***.
For more implementation related details, see the [github repo](https://github.com/grey93/proximus#proximus).
