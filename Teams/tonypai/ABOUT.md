Hi, I'm tonypai. Just graduate from school, this is my second global hackathon, the first one is nodejs knockout a.k.a. NKO, [Ninja Dart](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/lhc) is the work that time. This time I decided to attend on my own, hope have fun with you guys!

# What I'm going to do?

Game! Absolutey. Why? Because it's fun. What kind of it? Well, now it's just a thought, but I can tell you it's a co-op game. So, wait for it. :D
