I've been writing code for the web in one form or another since before there were any books on it.  I'd head to one of the 300 or so pages Yahoo had at the time, save it, change something, reload, and squeal with delight at what I learned to do that day.  These days, it's a career, but the passion hasn't waned one bit.

I spent many years toiling away for up to 100 hours a week with my own company, trying to just keep the lights on and the team paid and neglecting my own growth.  In the past couple years, I've regained my focus and thirst for new knowledge and languages.  I joined this hackathon because I want to challenge myself and play with new APIs... and I've had this site idea in my head for a while that matches one of the themes perfectly.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

I'm still fine-tuning my Javascript skills, but my long-time passion and strength is in PHP.  I've also been productive in Perl, Python, ASP and Java, and I'm getting my head around Node and Erlang.

I won't say much about the project and the APIs I plan to use as I feel it might give too much away, but I will say that I think it will be pretty far apart from what other teams will be doing.  You'll just have to wait and see.
