About me
===========================

I'm full stack web developer from Ukraine with over 3 years of web development experience. I like that job very much. I didn't find a team for myself, so it's a solo, but I'll do my best to deliver really interesting application.

#### Languages I use:
- Ruby
- Javascript
- Go

#### Frameworks:
- Ruby on Rails
- Backbone.js
- and others...

There is nothing special to say about the application which will be built, however I'm going to use some great APIs to deliver new interesting solution for cross-language communicating.
