TheTwoPeas
==========
We are two programmers from Hungary and good friends. We live near each other, helped each other developing our programmer skills and until recently used to work at the same place. We are really like two peas in a pod. That’s how we’ve came up with the name. And our nicknames helped: Pali & P. The two P’s. And P sounds like pea, right?!
We are awesome that way…

About our team
==============
Well, you already know where we are from and that we are best friends. And we are programmers. We are used to working together and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Not that we have much of the latter. :) We aren’t afraid of challenges and trying something new.
When not working, Pali plays chess, builds electronic devices and an enthusiastic watcher of TV shows. P likes to play computer games and music on his guitar, listen to music and running.
We joined the Hackathon, because we could not resist the challenge.

Skills
======
We know quite a lot languages and we’re gonna bore you with the list:
PHP, Javascript (Ajax), jQuery, ExtJS, Java, C/C++, C#, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, CSS, XML, HTML.
Pali will do the coding for the problems facing our planet theme (he loves science and his girlfriend is an Earth Scientist, so he listens to that 24/7) and P will do the EULA part because he likes torturing people. Just kidding… :)
