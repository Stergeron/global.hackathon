================

The name was chosen after Sophia proposed "code munchers" and Wiliam proposed the l33t version. Alan likes plain English better.


About us
===========================

## Sophia
I like building and learning things! Ya, that’s pretty much it. I really tried to make this more interesting and then I realised I was a boring person. And then I was like, hey, lets add a meme. Then I was like, “no, memes are to mainstream, I’m a software person, I can’t be mainstream.” So in the end: what is a computer scientists favourite beat: an algo-_rhythm_

## Alan
I have participated in many hackathons, mostly for fun. Many of the times I just do them because I have nothing better to do. Unlike many, I don’t have a _fiery passion_ for coding, but I find it interesting enough that I do hackathons.


## William

William didn't actually participate in the event, other than partly picking the name. He is kept here as an "honorable mention".


Our project

To solve world problems, we have to be aware of them first. Conflict mapper is designed to help raising awareness in young people about conflicts that happen aboard. We achieve this by aggregating news feeds about world conflicts and displaying this to the user in the form of a heat map. We also provide the user with links to articles that make up our dataset.
