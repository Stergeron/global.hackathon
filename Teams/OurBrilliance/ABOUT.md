We are a group of high school students with varying degrees of experience with code and a burning passion for creation! We're looking forward to working with all of the frameworks we can here!
This will be our second ever hackathon, but not together.  We're all here to learn as much as we can, and do our very best to make something great!
We're all psyched out to be a part of the world's first ever global virtual hackathon!

first hackathon. He is a grade 11 IB student hoping to continue his studies at the University of Waterloo for Software Engineering or Computer Science. 
Larry is fascinated by the world around him, like how engines work, why are some trees' bark so thick, why are there hats? 
and where is the human race headed towards. Larry is proficient in Java, HTML/CSS and a little bit of Objective C / Swift. Remember to
feed him regularly, as he becomes fiesty and will not work! (or maybe he's just lacking the essential nutrients to stay alive).
