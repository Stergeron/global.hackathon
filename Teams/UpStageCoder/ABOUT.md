I am web developer and currently working as Front End Developer at Vister Technology Inc. in Montreal, Canada. Programming is my passion and I love to work with web programming. When a new technology comes, I always try to learn it. I love to learn in every single corner on a technology. It feels amazing to me whenever I succeed solving/implementing a web development problem. We are a small team now, but I learn a lot of thing from my coworkers.
