We are calling our team (project) Infamy.  The name is because the final day of the competition is "a date which will live in infamy".  One of us loves history, and geography.  One of us is a movie buff.  One of us really enjoys learning design patterns, really.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

Jason Hughes (VonMises) is a father of three.  He and his wife homeschool their children.  He worked his way through college working in technical support for a software company that services the hotel industry.  After graduation he transitioned into development, bringing his coworkers (autt and jbeard88) with him.  VonMises is interested in working collaboratively on a project inside a defined window of time.  Even though they work together, they rarely get to be involved with the entire design and devlopment process in a collaborative way.

Our second team mate is Brandon McCartney (autt).  More info to come.

Rounding out the trio is Jeffery Beard (jbeard88).  More info to come.
