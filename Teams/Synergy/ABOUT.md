#About The Team

We are a group of friends of high school students and technology enthusiasts. We specialize in front and back end web development. This is also our first time working together on a large project. Each of us have our own skillset, and we feel like together we make a strong team. Altogether we are extremely excited for this Hackathon, and are planning to utilize our skills to the fullest to create an awesome web application. We all view this Hackathon as an amazing opportunity to improve and sharpen our skills, contribute to the Koding community, and raise awareness to help create the next generation of hackers.

Hello, I am Michael Leng, an aspiring 16 year old high school hacker. I initially started working with computers at the age of around 8, and started messing around with programming around 5 years ago. I mainly work with web languages, but have dabbled in languages like Java and C++. I enjoy coding for fun, skiing, and gaming. My main role in this competition will be front end development and design, as well as the coordination of the activities of other team members. This is my first hackathon, and I am extremely excited to participate.

Hi, I am Max Campbell, a 16 year old coder and general computer enthusiast from the UK. I started playing with computers at about the age of 7-8 (with bash scripts). I then started coding with php and dabbled in other lanaguges like C and Java, but loved the portability of the web. Now I mainly work with Node and am best at all things back end related. This is my 3rd hackathon; the other two were one week long and aimed at people my age.

Hello, I am Dennis Planting. I am 16 years old and from Sweden. I am a programmer and a server administrator. I have knowledge of multiple languages ranging from simpler languages like LUA and JavaScript up to languages like C++, Java and so on. I enjoy anything related to technology like coding, gaming, hardware hacking, etc. I can't call my self an expert in most areas, but I am fairly well rounded in everything, so my main role will be helping in multiple areas as well as helping where others know less.
