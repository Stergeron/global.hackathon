I've been a developer since learning C at the age of 12. Completly self taught and proficient in full-stack
web development. I've been working as a professional web &amp; software developer for the last 4 years, and now I'm
looking to break into freelance development, before starting my own company. I believe the Hackathon will allow me to
show my skills and prove what I can do, as I will show you a full-stack web application, front-to-back with clean,
tight code, in under 48 hours. I've worked with may bad developers and some good ones along the way, but I feel that I
really shine when I can take the ranes and lead the project from specification to deployment and beyond.

The prizes are great, but I'm more interested in making a name for myself and teaching my 14 year old
son about making HTML 5 games, since he wants to go to college to be a professional game developer and designer, 
once he finishes high school. I love the challege and hope you enjoy the project that I have built.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm a full-stack web developer, well versed in many languages, technologies, frameworks and api's.
I intend to build a complete application using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Javascript, AngularJS, MySQL, 
and all Hackathon sponsered api's, which are applicible to the application I'm going to build.

I don't want to give anything away, so you will have to wait and see....I can say it will be an HTML5 Game that 
introduces software development. :)

This is going to be AWESOME!!!
