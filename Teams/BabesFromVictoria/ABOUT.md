Total babes, right? We joined to learn and demonstrate our skills, and because a global hackathon sounds awesome!

Unfortunately, stress got the better of us and we have chosen not to participate in this hackathon, but instead study for our end-of-term finals. (Operating Systems, Database Management, AND Security Engineering?! Ickk!)

In any case, we wish the best of luck to all other teams! Happy Hacking!
