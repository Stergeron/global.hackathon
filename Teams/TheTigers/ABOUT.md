Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
======
I love coding, and it is not just my job, it’s my hobby, business, love, my life. 
For the short while I have been on this earth. Developing has been a huge part of my life, so much that if I didn’t have development I would be lost.
I love to play with it, In my spare time I surf the web to keep in touch with new technologies. 
I am working with web applications from last 4+ year.
I am also a nature lover, and I love more than coding, I try to help to save the nature.
I am also master degree student & family responsibilities so I have no much time to physically help them (http://support.wwfindia.org/sos/index.php) but I had decided to donate some part of my salary to them before two months. I also would like to donate 10% of my prize.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I will go with Theme#1 to develop application.
