# Hello!
We are team 0x1A4. We are all juniors attending the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

**Bio: **I'd say my life went pretty smoothly the first 14 or so years. Nearly everything was handed to me -- a loving family, close friends, and the like. It wasn't until high school that I realized I had faced almost no challenges. You might be thinking, "Well, isn't that a good thing?" And honestly, it was. I lived in a little bubble where nothing could touch me. This wasn't limited to traumas, though. I had minimal contact with the outside world, and, at the time, I didn't find anything odd about this. When I entered high school, I met people who knew things -- people who had been interacting with other people all over the world, and they did it right from a computer. Ah, a computer. It was with great reluctance that I accepted my first computer two months into freshman year. I didn't think I needed one, but little did I know, it would later become my greatest asset.

Freshman year. Foundations of Computer Science -- a required course, ironically. What did I know about coding? What did I _want_ to know about coding? A lot, as it turns out. I won't lie -- it took me a while to get used to the format of computer science. Logic, though. Logic, I loved, and I came to love the straightforwardness of computer science. Now, only 2 short years later, I'm taking advanced CS courses and hoping to become a computer science major. 

**Skills: **

I am fairly good at front-end development, and proficient at back-end.

**Bio:**

 I distinctly remember my first encounter with coding. In 6th grade, my teacher assigned a webpage to showcase the work we had created throughout the year. While we could just use a website builder, I was enticed by the raw power of creation I could achieve through coding; I remember borrowing stacks of books on HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to learn how to make cool animations and effects. While in hindsight it was just a simple website, really did change my life by exposing me to coding. Since then, I've taken all the advanced CS courses I could take, from AP Computer Science to Artificial Intelligence. What isn't offered in class, I have strived to learn on my own. This hackathon is a perfect opportunity to develop my programming skills and apply them to real world challenges

**Skills:**

While relatively new to web development, I have experience in scientific computing in Python. I am proficient in front-end development and android, but am still learning back-end.
