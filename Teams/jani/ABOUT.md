Hi, I'm Irakli and I just like participating in hackathons!

Skills & Idea
=============

My current development stack is around node & ruby

My idea is about solving a common file sharing problem with an awesome easy to use solution with a
secure p2p connection.
I'm fascinated about web so I'm gonna use many cool HTML5 features like web components and WebRTC
