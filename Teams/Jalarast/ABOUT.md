===========================

Being blind my whole life, technology has been my window into a world I couldn't see, I got started in te world of software development by writing [JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS) scripts to make programs work properly. I heard about the hackathon through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8517846), it sounded like a lot of fun, and I have a few ideas I'd like to work on.
