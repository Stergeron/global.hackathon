Shameless selfie taken at 5:30AM.. After a solid-ish 40-ish hours of Hackathon coding :D

Hello there, this is my on-man team page for the first Global Hackathon!

I'm a one man band and embarking on this challenge alone, let's hope I can manage. As a student in my last year of Sixth form in the UK, I've had to teach myself eveything I know about coding.
I started coding very early, maybe when I was 6, and loved it even at that age. Through the years, I've never stopped learning, and love a hard challenge.

Most of my free time is dedicated to hobby coding projects and hacking electronics!

I decided to participate in the Koding Hackathon because I love a challenge, and work well under pressure. Even if what I make in the end is no more than a demo, I'm sure I will have great fun making it and mingling with the Koding community!

##Skills:
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JS
 * PHP
 * MySQL
 * Java
 * C
 * C++
 * Pascal
 * Assembly (x86 with SSE&MMX)
 * Haskell
 * Ruby
 * Game Maker Language
 * Python
 * REST-API
 * NodeJS
 * JQuery
 * The list goes on...
 
But for the Hackathon, I think I'll mainly stick with PHP/HTML5/MySQL/JS/CSS5 maybe a smidge of C++ for backend... we'll see.

##The final product

Hacking is over for me.. I'm going to catch some rest... finally :D It's been a great coding weekend, I leave you with a demo of what you can do on http://ellisvlad.koding.io/ : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4vsT4hoKhs&feature=youtu.be">Demo on Youtube</a>

Had some laughs.. Had some cries.. All in all, pretty great hackathon.
