Hey there, I'm Frank, a German student currently interning in the Bay Area.
I love hackathons and hacking challenges, in which I participated a lot with fellow students.

Skills
=======
I love to develop in Go to solve data-intensive backend challenges.
Besides the usual HTML5/JS/CSS3 frontend stuff, I'm currently experimenting with Polymer.dart.
Most of my little projects (privately and at hackathons) run on the Google Cloud Platform.
