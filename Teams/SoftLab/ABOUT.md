Our team
===========================

We are Computer Science students at East Sarajevo University, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We like challenges so we decided to participate in global hackathon and to test our abilities and knowledge.


Our skills
===========================

Our field of interests are mainly about web and Android apps development.
We, as a team, have experience in php (Yii framework) programming, MySQL, 
JavaScript and frontend development in general, and Java development (Android apps).

We are still in brainstorming phase, and there are some pretty cool ideas...
