The HD One
================
Hello world! My name is Pavel, and I'm the only member of the team. It's my first hackathon and I hope it will be fun.

A little bit about me
===========================
I'm software engineer from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Decision to participate in Koding Hackathon was a spontaneous, but I think it's a very good chance for me to verify my experience in out of the ordinary situation.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
===========================

I will do a project which help to increase a number of users who read the legal documents on the web.

Planning to use Node.js as a main platform.
