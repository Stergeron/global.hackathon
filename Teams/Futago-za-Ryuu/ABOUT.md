| Can't find an image of my self, will upload one later and place it.

I've been programming for 8 years now, but only started seriously in the last 4 years,
and most of that time has been devoted to creating random Node.js projects, hacking away at them,
then dumping them! Dont get me wrong, its just after I've achieved a sense of satisfaction
from what I've done so far, my interest wanes so I move on. The only 2 consistant thing have
been trying to create my own programming language and creating a cross-platform/language
game using it.


About your skills and what you are going to do?

So far I've decided I'll be making a Three.js based game, still have to decide the rest.
