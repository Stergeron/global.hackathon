# The Y2K Problem

```python
print 'Hello World !'
```
The Y2K Problem is a one-person team for the Koding Hackathon. 
I am [Alex Mathew](https://twitter.com/alxmth03), a final-year Computer Science & Engineering undergrad at [SASTRA University, Thanjavur, IN](http://sastra.edu). 

This hackathon will be a major challenge for me for three main reasons :
* This is my first hacakathon.
* I am a beginner web developer.
* I didn't expect to get shortlisted, so I hadn't tried to assemble a team or decide a project to work on.

But that's the best thing about challenges - they are made to be taken down. I decided to go solo for the hackathon. I will have to dig deep to get this done, and that's the goal now.

## What am I planning to do

I'll be working on a way to introduce software development to beginners, because this is something that I can relate to. I help a lot of people get started with programming, so this hackathon will be a great platform to build a generic solution to help a wider range of people. I'll more specifically work on providing a way to get started with the coding part of software development, because that is the part that looks the scariest to people.

## What will I be using

* Python
* Flask
* MongoDB
* Pubnub API
* Anything else, as the need comes up
