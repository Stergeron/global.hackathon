About the team and team members?

I am Parth Pankaj Tiwary and I am from India, I am currently in the 3rd year of my 4 year bachelors degree in 
computer science and engineering. Data fascinates me and the way we structure our data in order to make some sense
out of it, I have a thing for typography and I am a strong believer of minimalist approach, I do try and keep things
simple.


About the skills that I have or I might use in this hackathon?

I have co-founded one startup that is frameinn.com, I do know Django, python and its recently that I have ventured
for MEAN stack and what can be made using MEAN stack.  I have a thing for data visualization, as it precisely explains
what minimalistic approach is. I guess that is most of it, I will be taking up a project related to the data and the
way we have structured our data so far and how should we go about changing it, in order to put it to its actual use.
