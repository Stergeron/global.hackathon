About reCode
============

Team reCode consists of just me, Aviral Dasgupta, a current undergraduate Computer Science & Engineering student at KIIT University, Bhubaneshwar, India. I've been programming since I was twelve and have dabbled in everything ranging from homebrew dev for the Gameboy Advance, to web development.

I like using technology to build smart solutions that get out of your way, but get your work done.

About Skills
============

I can comfortably switch from backend to frontend, and mobile. This project in particular will consist of an Android app with a Python backend deployed on Google AppEngine and a realtime frontend for the web.
