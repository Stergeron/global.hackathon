#About Us
jinx1337: My name is leo i am 34 years old and I love VB.NET
Well it was my first language, ok VisualBasic 6.0 was and I always seam to come back to vb. In this case vb.net.
I have worked with other languages php and python even tried ruby but basic is still my favorite. 
You know what they say you never forget your first language. Or is it love? :-p.

I started coding back when I was 14 years so I have been doing this for 20 years. 
I started with QuickBasic making quadratic equation solvers , prime-number generators and simple spelling games.
For this I went on to visual basic 5.0 then 6.0 and vb.net. I did try other languages Java,php,c++, python and C#.net.
