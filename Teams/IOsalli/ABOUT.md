Apadhaa is a dissaster information visualization tool which can easilly visualize information of natural disasters around the world. Apadha the applicaiton itself provides the facility to keep up with the news about each incident and get updates. IT provides facility to search through and visualize historical events within a given duration and also by each disaster type and the location.
