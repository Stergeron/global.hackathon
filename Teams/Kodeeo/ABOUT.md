I am a passionate web/mobile application developer coding since last 6 years. It was my hobby when I started coding.

But now-a-days, I can see it's actually a tool, a super power that you can use to solve problems - actually real life problems. To make human life more simple, comfortable and beautiful. To make a better world.

This is my main inspiration to join this hackathon and I will build something that will actually open a path to bring some goodness in people's life.

I will want other change makers to join me and be my companion to continue this run :) Happy coding!
