Axon
====

I am Daniel Masterson, a second year university student at the University of Hull (UK) currently studying MEng Computer Science With Games Development. I have been interested in programming since the age of 9 where I dove straight in (and straight back out again) to C++. My life has lead me through many languages - PHP, JavaScript, UnrealScript and my all time favourite C#. I'm here to show people what I can do with a free weekend and a lot of JavaScript.

Here's my face from that one time what I done did wear a suit to:

## Why 'Axon'

Because it sounds cool and technical, and my other cool and technical names have been used recently for other things so I kind of had to fall back to this. Also, an axon is a core component of a neuron, so natually it means this project is intelligent, right?

## My Languages

Where to begin...
- C and C++
- C# (And a bit of Java)
- PHP
- JavaScript with JQuery
- UnrealScript (with the Unreal Development Kit)
- Visual Basic if the need arises
- A bunch of other things I've dabbled in like x86 Assembly, Python, Ruby and more esoteric languages. I even made a Befunge interpreter in HTML and JavaScript because...uh.

## What I will be doing in the project

Due to my almost annoyingly deep knowledge into the intricacies and quirks of JavaScript and JQuery, a large quantity of code will be written in that with either a raw HTML or Canvas front end (I once made a 3D Doom-like engine using CSS 3D transforms on div elements, so I'm not limited to going way out of bounds here!). I personally have not use many frameworks or libraries, but I'll definitely investigate whats on offer and see if it will help in my project.
