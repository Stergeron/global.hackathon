Fluffle

Welcome to the Fluffle team page  :)


Team Fluffle (single person)
============================

Hello, my name is Kris and I'm a software engineer from Minneapolis, MN. 
Most of the work I've done in "the Industry"  has been data related ... 
data warehousing big data. Though I've worked in a variety of programming
languages, and have a deep understanding of data, I've rarely had the
opportunity to really explore front-end work and develop something really
slick that just begs to be used, clicked, played with.

(As a side note: ) "Fluffle" is what we called a pudgy little aging yorkie 
named Sunny we adopted from my mother in law years ago. It's my fondest 
wish that he's curled up in a soft blanket, snoring softly, 
weiner to the wind in the coziest of all contentment. I miss him, lots.


Skills
=======
Data: Databases (Oracle, Informix, MySql), ETL: Ab Initio 

Programming: PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, C, C++

Plan
====
I've picked my challenge! I am going to tackle challenge 3 and endeavour 
to make navigating site legalese (Terms of Service/Use, etc. less 
dreadfully boring)!

Tools I'l Use
=============
Node, Express, Jade, Mongodb, Phaser 2.0, assets from OpenGameArt.com
