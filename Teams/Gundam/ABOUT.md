Hello, we are a team mostly from Japan (Tokyo). However, our team is actually very international, consisting of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and Japanese! Our team name is called Gundam because we like ガンダム！Gundam/ガンダム is a Japanese giant robot mecha anime series and is very popular. Gundam represents our courage and our love of technology!

Although there is an explosion in the popularity of computer science in the United States and other countries, computer science and engineering is still looked down upon in Japan. Engineers are looked down upon in Japan, and being and engineer is not a popular job in Japan. We want to change this mindset and situation. Technology and engineering is making the world a better place, and Japanese engineers should contribute to that. If we win, we want to use this opportunity and make it so that all Japanese people will realize the power and potential of coding, computer science, and hackathons!

  TC Hackathon 2014 in Tokyo. ~135 people
</em></p>

私たちは、日本人、カナダ人、ベトナム人、中国人、韓国人のグローバルチームです。アメリカでは情報工学が人気のある学業であるのに対し、 日本ではまだコンピュータサイエンスの分野は人気が高くはありません。私たちはこの現状を変えたいと考えています。 もし、Global hackathonで勝つことができれば、日本の若い世代にコンピュータサイエンスの魅力を伝えることができると考えています。

Jumpei
=======
Jumpei Yamane is an accomplished and experienced manager of various hackathons in Japan, and is a prominent advocate/technology evangelist. He currently works at Givery Inc., and is also the Japanese ambassador for AngelHack, a premier developer relations platform, and is an organization that hosts massive Hackathons around the world. He aims to make hackathons popular in Japan and to make Tokyo the next hub for startup companies. He will be the UI/UX designer and co-director of this team.

Takuya
=======
Takuya is a skilled full stack web engineer who knows Java, Python, Ruby, and Scala. He will be working as the main developer of the team because of his strength in web engineering, and the fact that he knows lots of web technologies. He also knows some iOS and Android. He is very experienced. His profile picture is cute. [Website](https://www.facebook.com/takuya.miyamoto.9083)

Cherry
=======
Cherry is an engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and has a lot of Android and Java experience. She is passionate about Android development, technology, and internet of things. She is currently interning at Microsoft and wants to learn more web development from this hackathon. She will be one of the engineers of this team. She also really likes Gundam.

Tommy
=======
Tommy just recently started app development and web development, and he has fallen in love with it. He used to be a mechatronics engineer at the University of Waterloo, but recently switched to computer engineering so that he can get both a hardware, but more software engineering experience (he loves coding). He has definitely learned a lot of languages very quickly in frosh year, including python, iOS development, html, css, and JavaScript. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tommyjungis)

Nam
=======
Nam is the most recent member of our team, and has years of experience in Android and Java development, and came to Japan and is permanently working here developing Android applications. He frequently goes to the Tokyo Android Group, and is an avid fan of the mobile OS. He also has some web development experience as well, and can't wait to try and learn more about web development in this hackathon. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/butchigo)

About Our Project
=======
Many people want to help out others in need, but usually they don't. We wanted to create an application that will help give an incentive and more motivation to be more charitable. In order to do this, we created Donathon, a social web application where a user can be either an individual or a whole team of people who try to fundraise and donate money to natural disasters around the world. There is an interactive data map on our site where you can see real time natural disasters happening, and you can click on them and donate to them.

This service is meant to also give "tokens of appreciation" of users/teams that contribute and help the most! You can get points if you donate to these disasters, and users/teams with most points can get token of appreciation from us.

We are planning to give users virtual badges to share our appreciation to them, like how StackOverflow has those badges. We also plan to give top users great real life opportunities, such as being able to travel and volunteer at the place they donated in real life, or we can give them more materials/goods to help support their fundraising/donations.

Updates on Our Project
=======
1 hour in: We had to change locations to a place where we can all sleep over for two days. We are an hour late to the hackathon, and we have not programmed yet, but this is getting us pumped up!
24 hours in: Some of us slept for some time, and Jumpei-san had to go to another hackathon, but can still help us online. We are making some progress, but it is definitely a good learning experience! Two of us are learning lots about web development, as we never did it before.
