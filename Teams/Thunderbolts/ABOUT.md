First off, we just wanted to let you know that we are highschool students (Sophmores). We attend New Tech in Evansville Indiana!

Hi, our names are Maddox W, Jon P, and Elijah G. You could never call us "Expert coders", but eventually, if we try hard
enough we can usually always find a way to figure anything out together.

We decided to join the Koding Hackthon really for fun, and to learn more. We were so surprised that we got accepted out of the 20,000 applicants!
We were so excited to her that, and if we have thse chances, we might have the chance to win!

Just a couple guys who wanna code and have a good time!

If we every won this competition, which we might, we have definatly decided that some of the money will go to our school, but some we'd get to keep. :)
