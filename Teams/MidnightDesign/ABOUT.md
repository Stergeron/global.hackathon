I am Brooks Boyd; designer and developer. I love making wonderful things, and using code to do so is just another way to create art in my mind. I've been developing web applications for nearly two decades now, and joined into this Hackathon as a means to focus on one of several projects I've been toying around with.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm a long-time PHP developer, and as the technology has been shifting more client-side, getting more and more emphasis on Javascript in addition to HTML5 and CSS skills.

For this Hackathon, I'll be working on a project pursuing theme number 4 (HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented); I have a game I created years ago in PHP, that I'll be updating to use HTML5 advancements to make it much more interactive. I'll be utilizing the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) Javascript/[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) stack, and possibly adding in the PubNub service for game interaction notifications that need to be faster than Meteor's default two-way binding updates allow.
