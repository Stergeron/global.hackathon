BatCode
====

I am a developer who is passionate with what I do and am always trying to learn new languages/techniques to make
myself the best developer possible.

This is my first ever Hackathon and I am really looking forward in taking part.

My team is also open to anyone else who would like to join, just submit a pull request onto my repository at
https://github.com/Michael-Brooks/global.hackathon I will then merge it in and and send it over to Koding's repo.
