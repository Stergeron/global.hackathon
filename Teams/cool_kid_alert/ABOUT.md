##Alan

Just a high schooler on the east coast who wants to test his skills. 
I doubt I will win, but I just want to see what participating feels like. 
Never really knew what I wanted to do until my first day of Freshman year, when I walked into Computer Science class Period 1. Hello World in Java seemed magical to me, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I "grew up".
Since then, I've tried to learn as much as I can, as fast I can. I found myself overreaching at one point, trying to become a coding polyglot- I was trying to learn 3 or more languages at once, which did not work. So I focused on learning a few things, and learning them well.
  And I got an internship at an informatics lab! 

##Kevin
  Known as "Bear". Algorithm master and High School math wiz. Straight out of ~~Compton~~ Longmont.
  I'm pretty sure I'm cooler than Alan. I think. CSS is my specialty and Netscape is my favorite browser.
  I like to work with C/C++, so if you need help, I'd be happy to give you some **pointers**.

#Skills/Experience
##Alan: 
Javascript, Java, HTML/CSS, a little Python and Ruby.
D3.js, Node, Sails.
##Kevin:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, C.


We want to make an interactive website to explain and visualize the changes in global temperature over the years.
Obviously, we'd use d3.js for that. Planetary.js, which uses d3, would be nice for easily plotting the globe.
Another cool idea would be a way for people to highlight the most important parts of a legal document for users to read and then some sort of game to make sure people read those sentences, at least.
