Team Hairball is a team of Python hackers who also like to hack the frontend JS. More than winning, we joined to have some fun and hopefully build something awesome. We live and breath for hacking and want to have fun competing with peers.

## Our Project

Project: [Localvore.Guide](http://dev.localvore.guide/)

Localvore.Guide is directory of small, local businesses so that you can be a 
smart local consumer.

Localvore.Guide uses a Django backend powered with PostGIS so we can do fast 
geospatial queries to find the best places near you. On the frontend we've 
implemented Material Design with AngularJS. While right now the app is
hosted on the web, this combination allows us to package the app for Android 
and iOS by just expanding our build process.
