I'm Vladimir, a [freelancer at oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/users/~01c0d7f151e8f88b99), software developer, entrepreneur and dog breeder (seriously!). Personally I would like to thank Koding and team to give developers from over the world an opportunity for collaboration and communication. 
I'm happy to see NGINX as partners of this event.

Our team is completely virtual and remote. I met Rodion on Twitter few days ago and have never seen him before. He is great and I love to read his code, that's why we hack together at *OrangeVerse*.

'OrangeVerse' is the random name created using [Koding Global Hackathon Team Name Generator](https://vast-cove-6783.herokuapp.com/), which I created a few days before to give the name for our team. :-)

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *build great thing* during the hackathon and *show what the random can do*. Taleb's Black Swan. In Random We Trust.

Sincerely yours,
Vladimir and Rodion. :p
