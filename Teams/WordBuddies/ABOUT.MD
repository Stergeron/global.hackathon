Word Buddies
================

Here is a **real story**:

> **Cihan**  and **Aylin** are living together in beautiful Berkeley. 
>
> Cihan works at a high-tech company in San Francisco; 
>
> while Aylin goes to school at UC Berkeley for her Phd. degree in Law. 
> 
> Often times she comes across interesting English words at school which she wants to practice and learn. 
>
> Since some of the words and terminology are used in both of their subjects, this would benefit them both. 

There was one little problem, though: 

> There wasn't an easy way of sharing words with each other throughout the day, 
>
> other than sending whatsapp message or emails. Both of which, suck. 

Here, at **WordBuddies ™**, we will&hellip; 

* present lists of words in an intuitively **accessible** way;
* With **fun**; 
* and with **competition**.

**WordBuddies ™** is (*or, let us say, "will be"*) an addictive platform for all word-lovers.

> You will learn vocabulary using the **BuddyEffect ™** and **gamification**, without even realizing that you do!

**ahem** \'nuf hints already, wait for the hackathon demo **;)**.
