Fraz Ahmed
===========================
Passionate Web Engineer, a Self Employed Entrepreneur and father of two. This is my first ever hackathon and I want to use this as an opportunity to learn something new. I am positive that in the end of this event my team will put something valuable on the table. This small effort of us will also have a positive impact to the world in one way or another!

Faraz Ahmed
===========================
I've been doing web development since last six years. Last year, I quit my job where I was going nowhere and took a chance with freelancing - something I never thought I would be successful in. That experiece changed my mind, improved my self-esteem, which was at its lowest point, and defeated my fear of failure. More about that experiece [here](http://farazahmed.co/overcoming-fear-of-failure/). This Hackhaton is an opportunity for me to defeat some more of my fears and bad habits, like never completing what I started, or even getting started on something. I am writing this at the end of the submission of our project and I feel that I've conquered my fears. :)
