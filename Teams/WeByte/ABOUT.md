#We Byte

We're a group of five coders from Egypt, and we take our dreams very seriously. We've decided to join because this is a really good chance for us to get Egypt noticed, and perhaps, sponsored somehow to spread the Computer Science culture in it. We've been given a once in a lifetime chance, and we don't intend to waste it.
