Hi everyone.My name is Hristo and I'm a 19 years old software engineering student. I'm going to be building a WebGL game using
Three.js & Javascript(of course). I have an idea about the game and I won't be revealing it just yet so stay in touch.

I'm also looking for people to join my team that's why I will give you a brief introduction about what I can do and what my skills are.
For the past 6 months I have been working in a company in the area of computational chemistry. I'm involved in projects which
for the most part solve problems with the help of graph theory. This is where my strength lies. I"m also a C# certified specialist
and I have some good amount of experience developing applications & also a good amount of presentation skills. I'm also lucky enough
to be a MSP and MCP. If you are passionate about games and like to create stuff that move please don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm looking for technically skilled persons and design and user interface is going to be the second most important thing.

Thanks !
