# Blue Shirt Academy

West Michigan Aviation Academy is a STEM-based highschool operating out of Grand Rapids, MI. It has a focus on engineering and aviation and the uniform requires students to wear khaki pants and blue shirt thus giving us our name. Go WMAA!

## About Us

I am a senior at WMAA and I have been exposed to technical design and programming for about 7 years. I am interested in physics and theoretical computer science. These interests have gotten me involved at Michigan State University in a mesoscopic physics lab and as an intern at the Van Andel Institute of Science engineering experiments with code.

I am a junior at WMAA and I have an interest in all areas of math and science. I am especially interested in biomedical sciences and I work in a vasospasm lab at Grand Valley State University. I am new to coding but I am fascinated by the mechanics of web design. It's been eye-opening to be involved in such a male-dominated field and I look forward to applying my skills to new areas of math and science.
