TL;DR: Travis, Peony and Jason are partial-full stack developers and Manu is a janitor. They all share a common love for science.

1. Peony is a web designer and front-end developer. She prefers to work at the bleeding edge of front-end spec, and her workflow would probably make Paul Irish jealous.
2. Manu is not a janitor IRL, he's more like a services savant. If you need service development, or simply some sweet Python magic, he's your man.
3. When he's not busy saving the world from best practice failures or thinking of what to tweet next, Jason is busy building stuff while using a mindblowing variety of resources. Apps, web-apps, APIs, you name it. If Macgyver needed the equivalent of a developer swiss-army knife, Jason would make the role.
4. Travis is a front-end developer who has a lot of experience with devops because it "comes with the territory". In a previous life, he was a backend dev. On that note, he's currently doing his best to hate PHP and love NodeJS.

Joining was Peony's idea, and needless to say, we all jumped at the chance to be a part of global hackathon. Win or lose, we're looking to challenge ourselves by implementing as much as possible into our final idea. 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Python
- Scala
- Objective C
- Java
- PHP

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- DATADOG
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

We're trying to come up with an impressive idea that has a tight-enough scope to complete in time. Ideally this is going to be a web-app that's out-of-the-box in nature, is built on services leveraging a plethora of APIs, and has a gorgeous front end. After throwing ideas around for the past few evenings, the team is mostly talking about going with either themes #1 or #5.
