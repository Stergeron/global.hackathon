Hi, I am Prashanth. I am a free thinker :D
you too are free to think ofcourse!
I keep reminding myself that freedom is all we need. I try to break free of all things that bind me. Things like jobs.

I would like to create that which is necessary for freedom, just for the love of it.

Ok, enough philosophy. I am a test and automation engineer, was a freelance programmer coding in scientific computing
till about half a year ago, I am a Python programmer and I am in love with everything that is open source *Github rocks*.

Why did I decide to join Koding Global Hackathon?
Lately I have been ideating a lot. Now I have a whole bunch of ideas, unimplemented, untested. So I see this hackathon as
a nice opportunity to make something fun.

About my skills and what I am going to do?
====

I can pretty much handle python. So I would like to use Flask and polymer.js to make a simple app.

What is this app about?
Patience my friend. All I can tell you now is, its got to do with unlocking myself and the world along with me :D

All the best! and thanks for wishing me luck ;)
