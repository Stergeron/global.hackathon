We all live in the same city and know each other personally, but never tried
to work as a team... though some of us do work together. So why not try?  
After all, who would resist an opportunity to spend 48 hours coding? :)

**Sergey** is a team lead by trade and he was trying to lead this team too, though in this case he had competition as the idea of the project hasn't originated from him. He's a great proffessional, very driven and commited wholly to coding.

**Yurks** is the best UI developer we've ever had an honour to work with. He's also the tallest team member, which usually allows him to have the best place in a taxi cab (near the driver). Otherwise his long legs wouldn't fit.

**Oleksiy** is one of those people you envy, because they can do anything they put their mind to. He's literally Google material, so suck it up, Google, he's with us and we ain't gonna part with him for no reason. Unless of course he wants to.

*rudeg* is simply Javascript God. He was teaching us, mortals, ReactJs for the whole two days.

**Marina** is the most beautiful software developer you have ever seen, seriously. And she's tolerably smart, too. She is also fond of cats, bears, hedgehogs, knitting and the like :)

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are two Java, one Python, and two Javascript developers.
Chances are that we're going to code in a completely different stack
(Clojure/ClojureScript?) though. 

Our goal is to scratch our own itch and to build a service that would help to write better in foreign languages.  Natural languages, I mean, like English.

spellcheckr.io
==============

Do you have to write in a language that you feel you don't know too well? Are you a student and study foreign languages? 
Maybe you need to write an occasional email to a client and you're not sure you
can express yourself well enough?

Do you ever feel like Master Yoda?
You are supposedly great and mighty. But people still hide their smiles when they listen to you.

Why is that? Because you **speak funny.**

>>> “Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path,
forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Suppose Master Yoda used our service before he made this speech!
This is what he'd be likely to get:

>>> “Anger, fear, aggression; they are the dark side of the Force.
They flow easily an are quick to join you in a fight. Once you start down the dark path,
it will forever dominate your destiny, it will consume you, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Not so funny anymore huh?
What we offer is a proofreading service with users ready to help you around the clock.
World is wide; when they sleep in Australia, they are wide awake in Austria! Which is
exactly what makes your chances to get a quick, real-time response all the better!

So, if you want to improve your writing, hop in in and post your text snippet here!
Or if you feel like you should be the one proofreading others, by all means join
our forces on the other end of the channel! Just switch to the Suggestions page and fire away!
