I'm Ivan and I just looooooove little software and hardware helpers that make life easier.
But sometimes little things overgrow to big ugly monster, so it's better to kill them than develop -__-.
I hope, this time I'll focus on one thing and won't use whole bucket of technologies
just for one simple purpose. :)

# What skills do I have?

Well, I'm kinda web developer with mixin of mobile developer who can speak following languages
(and speaks them in daily life):

 - PHP
 - golang
 - C# (Silverlight)
 - Javascript

My idea is to work on gathering and processing one kind of statistics that will serve well to 80%
of possible users. I'll focus on usability, because "usable" thing means "something that helps me
every day".
