# 41 North Studios LLC

My name is Jim Armstrong, and I am the president of 41 North Studios LLC, a small web-design and programming agency
located in Norwalk, CT, USA.

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. I want to challenge myself and see if I can 
take a concept from idea to execution in 48 hours by myself. Above all, I'm hoping to have some fun, learn some 
new things, and be amazed at what everyone creates!

## My favorite languages

I mostly code in C#, Java, and Ruby. For this project I will likely default to Ruby since I am confortable with it 
and think my development time will be faster. However, depending on what I decide to build I may just try a language 
I'm not as familiar with to make this a good learning experience.
