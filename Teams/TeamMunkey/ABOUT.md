# TeamMunkey

I'm Sreejith. I work, I play. Work, most of the time. But my work is my play. I make RC airplanes and play guitar when I'm not coding.

## About Us

- I'm a lone participant. For me, this hackathon is about pushing myself. Squeezing every drip of creative juice out of me in a very short time.

## Languages 

Python does most of the dirty work for me. Objective-C is my another playground. I'm perfecting my Javascript skills. But wouldn't call myself a Sensei yet.
