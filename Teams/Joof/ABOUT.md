Awesome team having a damn royal experience in hardware, software, anywhere.

We have skills to design, to code and to make anything looks pretty good.

### Skills

Have you seen a combination of Raspberry Pi, Arduino and lathe? We did it! Have you seen a backend for it? Oh, it's interesting. May be mobile app for it? Or just remote controled robot?

So, we develop backend systems, frontend and mobile apps. It seems to be a full-stack.
