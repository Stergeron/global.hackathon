Hi, I'm Yishu. I should be doing homework right now, but this koding thing sounds so cool.

## About me

A few years ago, I took a programming class in high school,
became a little familiar with C,
and totally fell in love with programming.

Now I'm in college, took my first physics class, 
we used vPython during lab to model physics,
and now I'm even more in love with coding.


It makes me happy :)

## Languages

vPython (python?),
C
