Pierce Stegman

I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  When I was 7, my dad bought me a book on HTML.  I started coding basic websites, and wanted to do more.  A few years later, my parents bought me Adobe CS4, and I began to make Flash games.  As I made games, I often asked myself how I could make games that helped people.  At first, I began to make educational games.  After a while, I decided I wanted to make things other than education games. As I looked into different things that I could make, I began to learn different languages.  In the process, I learned PHP, JavaScript, C++, C#, and recently HTML5.  I also took an interest in artificial intelligence.  Some examples of projects I made are a cryptocurrency exchange, an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, a system that lets one deploy code via email, and a GUI wallet for cryptonote currencies.

Hi, I'm also a junior at TJHSST. I've been playing with web development since I was 8, which led into other languages (I still remember when I wrote BASIC). Today, I'm skilled with Python, Ruby, JS and C. In the seven years between then and now, I've written numerous snippets, tools, and web apps, picked up GNU/Linux, participated in a number of competitions (1st place MITRE STEM CTF 2013, 2014, 3rd place BAH Data Science Bowl, 6th place PicoCTF 2014), went to hackathons (PilotPhilly, PilotDC, MHacks IV, Hack the North 2014), and learned a lot. I'm currently a student systems administrator at TJHSST, where I manage the systems behind our public-facing website, student intranet, and Linux lab. I look forward to (hopefully) participating in and learning from Koding's hackathon.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

I am most skilled with backend development, artificial intelligence, and crytocurrencies.  We have an idea that will make use of AI to make reading the TOS and Terms and Conditions on a website not only fast, but easy and fun.

I'm good at backend, data visualization (Chart.JS, gnuplot, others), and systems administration. I'm not that bad at frontend development, and Pierce has already summed up what we'll be doing.
