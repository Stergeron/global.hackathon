Hello, my name is Jack Atkinson! I'm an Australian citizen born July, 1996 who moved to America in 2005 which
is where I currently reside. Since I first gained the ability to turn on my mothers computer I have had an avid
interest in how they work. My curiosity was not getting me into too much trouble until I had a failed attempt at
dual booting her computer with Ubuntu. The end result of that endeavor led to her computer being sent back
to HP for the first time. That interest has manifested itself into a love for programming and solving problems
with computers. After delving deeper and deeper into the land of software development I had heard about hackathons
but thought they were a little bit above my level. When I read about Koding's Virtual Hackathon that was mostly
aimed towards High School students, I thought I should give it a shot and to my astonishment and excitement I was
accepted! One fact that made this competition stick out to me was that I didn't need to travel anywhere which made
it easily accessible as I am in my senior year at high school.
