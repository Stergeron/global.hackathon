I am a final year Software Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

If I am not coding, I am either climbing things (rocks, trees ...) or trying to get discovered by a bear in a forest. Or finding a roof in town that is cool enough to hang out on. Also, generally trying new things.

Why I decided to join?
=======
As a student with finals this week, I decided to join a hackathon for the fun of it. And trust me, they are super fun. Ah, I feel the adrenaline already!!

Between CO-OPs and part-time jobs, I have around 2.5 years of software experience. Along with an engineering degree, I don't find time for extracurricular projects. That's why I am joining this hackathon. I once joined a hackathon by Facebook and it was the BEST thing ever. After that, I started treating all my assignments as hackathons. Pfff of course I don't leave them till the last minute just so I am  can pull an all-nighter and get it all working with extra features just for fun. No! ... Yes, yes I do. It feels so AWESOME to create something spectacular in a heck of a sleepless night.

About my skills
=======
I worked on back-end, front-end and everything in between. So far, I worked on 6 different projects and each used different technologies and were in varying fields (networking, cloud/OpenStack, vision processing, web development (check out OrbitHub.com), medical applications, ...)

Some of the languages I know: C, C++, HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, Perl, Java and others

What I am going to do?
=======
The project will be related to distributed systems algorithms.

Currently there are so many distributed algorithms out there with tedious pseudo code and big blocks of text that lose meaning. So I'll be developing a program to help visualize these algorithms. This will cover theme 2 of the hackathon.

The web app can be later expanded to add more algorithms.

Will be coding in Java.
