I Code As Root
================

We are New Zealand EXTREME development team. You wanna software? Fine! We will write it on your hardware, for your hardware, as root, without backups and VCS! Cause its ~~STUPID~~ EXTREME! LOL! Besides, if you want it written on C++, we will write an entire Linux kernel for 5 second, and then just push V8 on top of it, so you can have JavaScript when you need C++ or any other pointless languages, cause JS rulez. XD
