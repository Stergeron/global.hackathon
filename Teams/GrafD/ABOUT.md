GrafD team
================

Hey!

![Sergey](avatar.jpeg?raw=true "Sergey")

I'm software developer from Russia, Chelyabinsk. 
I'm coding more that 15 years from early childhood.
Interested in web and game development.
Last time I very often use HTML5 + CSS3 + JS for wide range of projects.

Why GrafD?

D is the first letter of my family. Graf D. is one of the songs of the group I love (Piknik).
Thats why. :-)
