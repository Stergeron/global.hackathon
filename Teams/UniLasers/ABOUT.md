UniLasers
=============

We're team UniLasers, a small team of two people based out of Toronto. We consider ourselves hobbyist programmers, we enjoy programming but don't have enough chances to do so at work or after work. Neither of us have ever participated in a Hackathon before, but this global Hackathon seems like a great place to begin! 

It's time to see how well we stack up against the other 1999 teams in this Hackathon! 

What we're going to do
=============

Honestly, we're not sure yet. One of us is stronger with backend technologies, one of us is better with frontend, so we'll see how that goes.

We're still deciding between the first and third theme as those two plays to our strengths, we'll commit a change to this file once we decide!

For sure we'll be making use of PHP, nginx, and a bunch of JavaScript libraries that can help us code fast in 48h. Any other APIs and technologies will be determined once we decide on a theme.
