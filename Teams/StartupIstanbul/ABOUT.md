<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/startupistanbul/" target="_blank">Startup Istanbul</a> is a Facebook group where a bunch of startup people from Turkey meet and exchange ideas. After Özgün sharing this hackathon we've jumped in and decided to give it a go. 

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We want to hack together some interesting ideas like encryption for privacy, or argument grouping on social media, etc.
