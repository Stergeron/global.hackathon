I am software developer and want to realize my idea in koding hackaton


About me
===========================


I am 26 and software developer and some monthes ago I found are there any online hackatons. And it was very surprisingly when I didn't find any. 
But now  I have got a mail from elance with explanation of koding.com hackaton and was very happy to know about it.
When I registered and was approved for participating I found that first theme (about global problems of the Earth) is very interesting for me.
I want to make something interesting, beatiful and of course  useful . And I want to win not for the money but for the communication with interesting people.


About my skills
=======
I think that programming is general skill. But of course there must be the platform where a programmer realizes his ideas.And 
nowadays I am focusing on web projects. I program on C# for ASP.NET /MVC/WebApi platforms, Javascript (jQuery and Angular.js mainly) for frontend. And I love alghoritms and especially I  like machine learning and big data, and using for it Python (May be I will move to that language in future :) )
