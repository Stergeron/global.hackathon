# Coddee Break Team

We are Kuzma and Vadim, we like both hacking and games, and we believe it's sometimes the same thing!

## About us

* *Kuzma* — Being mostly PHP back end web developer recent years, used to code in a variety of languages starting from low-level assemblers to exotic Prolog.
* *Vadim* — Third year university student, full-stack PHP+HTML+CSS+JS web developer, interested in games.

## Our goals

We love creativity and we want to show anybody it can be pleasure to build your own program. Who likes boring lessons? Who likes lessons at all? Let's play and then you realise you can do much more and it's fun!
