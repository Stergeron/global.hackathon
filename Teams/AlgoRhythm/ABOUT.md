#Team AlgoRhythm
Unfortunately we have been unable to complete our project during the hackathon.

We bagan with a plan to create an educational music game about introductory Computer Science, but quickly decided that we wanted to go in a bit of a different direction.  We finally settled on creating a unique sort of game that through its mechanics would both exemplify and educate the player about an issue we feel strongly about: inclusivity.  It's horrifying how often individuals are excluded from various communities for entirely unrelated traits.  We need to learn to rally together bound by our commonalities, not drive each other away based upon our differences.

Hopefully we will finish this project in the near future, and then have the opportunity to share it with you all.
