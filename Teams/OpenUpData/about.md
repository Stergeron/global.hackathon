OpenUpData
================
We're team OpenUpData, or more accurately I am. A solo team consisting of John Volock from Albuquerque, NM. I've been interested in computer and programming as long as I can remember, back to QBasic and Windows 3.1, and have a degree in Computer Science and have been working in the field for a few years.

This is my first online hackathon, and first one since I graduated from school.  I'm currently working on building a portfolio of personal projects, and am looking forward to having something to show here! I've always enjoyed coding in my spare time and do a lot of it, though not anything web-based, and very little of it do I post online, so I'm looking forward to this new challenge.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

Web application developement is new to me, so definitely going to be an adventure. There's such a plethora of Data Sets available from the White House data initiative, so I'm planning on building a quick framework and interactive viewer for playing with/building visualizations from this data, and to allow easy importing and exporting to some of the most common tools (Matlab, R, SPSS, etc). I think getting the data more accessible and easily viewed is a big first step in getting the worlds problems better seen.
