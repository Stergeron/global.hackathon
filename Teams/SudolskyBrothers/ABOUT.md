# Sudolsky Brothers

As it is apparent from the name of our team, we are brothers programming together - we have participated in various projects
ranging from small games for mobile devices to big information systems. We love challenges and we are happy to be a part of the Hackathon.


# About the team

# What we are going to do

All the given themes are really interesting and it is rather hard to pick one. As we like games and web development very much,
we want to stay within this direction. We would like to use Nginx, Nodejs, Javascript, HTML5 and some awesome API to realize our project.
Our goal is to create something creative and helpful.
