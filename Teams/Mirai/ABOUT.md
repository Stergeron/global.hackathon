#Welcome, we're team Mirai （未来）！


#About Us
Neither of us have a lot of experience in anything specific, but we hope to learn a lot from being in this Hackathon (also our very first!)
We are both of Grand Rapids, Michigan and we are seniors at West Michigan Aviation Academy. 


- Brandon Azer -
Currently a senior in high school. My desired major in college in Computer Science. I have taken a small course in VB.net, curently learning and developing an iOS application and learning Swift as I do that. I'm really interested in how programs work and I've started to make plans for future projects as I learn new things. In my free time, I like to play Osu (music game) and games in general, play piano, and learn Japanese. 大学後で、日本に住みたいです。

I don't have much programing experience other than a course in VB.net but I would like to gain experience. One of my main hobbies is being part of First the robotics club. 
I am deciding on Majoring in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.
