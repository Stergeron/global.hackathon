# The Alan Turing Project

The Alan Turing Project is comprised of Anshul, David, Mukul, Matt, and Nick. We are software engineers in Columbus, OH.

## About Us

-Anshul: I like C#, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Angular, Java.
-David: I’m a Rubyist looking to learn more languages. I also was intrigued by Edward Tufte’s ‘Visual Display of Quantitative Information’ years ago, and I am looking forward to making a ‘User Oriented Display of Quantitative Information’ that can help users realize how they impact the planet. I’m excited about this project, and I’m especially excited about how it applies datamining to a humanitarian task.
