The Thought Engineer
================

This is Samer Bechara, The Thought Engineer. I'm participating in this koding hackathon for a change, for a challenge, and winning! (Doh!)


About me
===========================

I've been developing web applications since 2007, and by 2010 I became pretty good - or that's what I like to think.

I've been working online since 2007 , back when we had 128Kbps internet here in Lebanon. For the first few years, my parent and my friends thought I was crazy, but then I understood that I was making money online, not trying to run away from finding a real job.

I've decided to joing because I wanted to challenge myself, and solve some of the problems in your koding themes (No- I'm not telling which one now - we still haven't started!)

I don't care if I win or not, seriously! What I really care about is overcoming myself and pushing my boundaries. Winning is just a secondary result, not the main goal. (Judges - don't let that influence you. I still like to win)


What am I really good at, and what am I going to do?
=======

The more complex the problem is, the simpler the solution I come up with. I've programmed tens of APIs, done frontend and backend programming, managed servers, and market my own business. 

Programming isn't just about writing code, it's about solving problems the world is facing. If you want to kill my soul, ask me to reinvent the wheel. I focus as much as I can on creating innovative solutions for problems that my clients are facing. If a solution has been already created, no need to create it again. Programmers, you can change the world, so stop writing contact forms! :)

Most probably I'll be working on solving the TOS problem. As a website owner and website visitor, it's a problem I fairly undertand and now, and believe that I have some pretty cool ideas to solve this problem.
