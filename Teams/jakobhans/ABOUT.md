Andrea
======
A visual arts student, graphic designer with curiosity for the programming world, currently focusing on frontend projects. Loving the CSS3, and all the creative world around it. This will be my first hackathon, hope to have a lot of fun and learn as much as I can.

Jakob
======
I'm a self-taught coder who studied marketing in college. For the last 7 years I've been developing mobile and web apps and really enjoying it. Trying to grow and learn as much as I can.
I've been to two hackathons previously, one in Barcelona (my former home) and the other one in Berlin. Really like the vibe one gets in this kind of competitions and the growth attainable from seeing other peoples projects.

=======
Together we count our strengths as:
- UI/UX problem solving
- Art direction
- Client side programming (JS)
- Front-end design and programming (HTML5 / CSS3)
