Project Scarlet Sails
================

Set in a small fishing village _(also known as The City of Sails)_, we share passion for technology and the dream to make world a bit better place to live. As our [name alludes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Sails), we're all about not losing hope and believing that miracles do happen.


We are...
===========================

* Timur - crunching some serious ERP business by day, exploring exciting new tech by night
* Dana - driving one of the country's busiest websites


Skills and plans
=======

So far theme #2 looks like our best candidate, but things may change over the next week.
Ourselves, we know a thing or two about C#, Python, Angular.JS and where to get awesome coffee during the weekend. We believe that should get us somewhere :)
