Koding's instructions for writing ABOUT.md tell you to make it emotional and impressive. I find it more important to make it honest. I'm Frederik Creemers, a Belgian web geek. I'm visually impaired. My optic nerves never fully developed, so glasses don't help.
Because of my impairment, I've always needed the help of technology. In high school, at a point where I was supposed to be doing homework, I started toying around in powerpoint. I found out a feature that allowed you to go to a different slide when the mouse hovered
over a certain element of the current slide. This gave me the great idea to create mouse mazes, where you had to get your cursor from start to finish without touchhing a wall. This got me more interested in how games were created, and so I  downloaded GameMaker, a tool by YoYoGames,
that allows you to create games without programming. It does include a language called GML (game maker language), which was my introduction to programming. At school, we learned how to make a website, which introdduced me to the wonders of the web as a platform, and that's what got me to where I currently am.

The reason I'm entering this hackathon, is because I sometimes need a little push to release something. I've got a lot of projects in my 'dev' directory that are hafway there to being something I could release to the world. I'm hoping that this hackathon will push me to create something that I can be proud of.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm creating an app that allows people without any coding experience to create their own web application.
Some of the things I'll probably use:

 - blockly
 - github's api
 - Google App Engine
 - Any other APi I can build in in time that can enhance the applications that users build.
 
I might change my mind, and build applications using firebase instead of App Engine.
