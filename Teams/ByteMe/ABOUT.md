Team ByteMe
================

We're Bhavna and Josephine, here to have some fun while making cool stuff that people use. We met at Carnegie Mellon University's Master of
Entertainment Technology Program, and have been friends ever since. Bhavna is a coder; Josephine is a designer; we both like music,
games, and art, so it really is a match made in tech heaven!
