Dhi is a baker at http://rockybars.com, while Irfan is a university student. We're motivated to get involved to push the limit of ourselves, that we can give something to the *universe*!

Dhi loves to code in **c++**, and also **javascript** (who doesn't love javascript?), especially on top of **nodejs**. Dhi has managed to have some [npm modules](https://www.npmjs.org/~diorahman).

Irfan very good in **php**, **html5**, **css** and also **javascript**. He loves to play with frontend thingy.

What you are going to do?

We're interested in exploring theme number 1 or 3. We will try to combine the available APIs with our capabilities to deliver suitable app to answer the narrated problems.
