About my team
===========================

My name is James Tookey and I'm based in Cheltenham, UK.

Having never participated in a hackathon before, I thought it was about time to give it a go!


About my skills and what I am going to do?
=======
I'm a software engineer specialising in PHP, AngularJS and NodeJS.

I'm going to be creating something mobile based using AngularJS.
