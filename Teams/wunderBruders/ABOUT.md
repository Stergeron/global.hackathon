##The Wunderbruders!

###About our team

We are two brothers originally from Brazil, but now both living in different parts of Germany.
Our love for games brought us across the ocean to work in the digital games industry!

_Game Artist, Salsa Dancer, Latin Lover._


Starting in Brazil he has been exploring the world of game graphics in search of new exciting challenges.

His new quest brought him to work at MegaZebra in Munich, after having lived and worked in Recife, Helsinki, Berlin and Paris.
His amazing graphical skills will bring beauty to the project.

_Programming Nerd, Coffee Drinker, Sleepy Dad._


Also from Recife, Brazil, this guy made his way to Berlin to start a new life with new challenges in the Old World.
Unlike his brother, he decided to set foot and stay in just one place.

He now works as an Objective-C developer at Memorado, making Brain Training games, but his hobby is to code Javascript and get other people excited about programming.


#### Lucy SPY

_Groovy Spy, Funky girl, Digital Soul_

Lucy is the heart and soul to our project. With her funky moves and groovy spy abilities, she has the potential to bring the joy of programming to people who have little or no contact with coding.

She uses Python as her main weapon and she aims to eradicate the world from fear of programming (and recover some stolen diamonds while at it).

Even though she is a product of our imagination, and we've known her for only a weekend, she lives in both our hearts already.


#### The Project
During this weekend we have developed an HTML5 game to teach programming. We really put a lot of effort into character design, animations and sounds in order to make it a really awesome experience for people who don't yet know how to code.

We hope to encourage people to try their hands at Python and be introduced to the world of programming in an engaging and fun way.

We will continue the game as an open-source project after the Hackathon with the intent to make it an official [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/) tutorial. We hope to get a lot of support from the open-source community.
If next year, during the Hour of Code, thousands of people fall in love with Lucy and her groove, our mission is complete! :)


#### Special thanks
We'd like to thank the Koding team for inspiring us with this amazing theme. Being brothers working in the same industry we have been planning to make a game together for years but this was the first time we actually did it. This was an amazing weekend.

Thank you! :)
