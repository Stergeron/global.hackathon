Unfortunatelly couldn't finish it on time, the project was a racing game where people could give their first steps on the programming.

The race engine is almost complete, the JS interpreter needed little work (using PEG.js) and the web interface needed a LOT of work.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

I heard about the hackathon through a friend and decided to join.

This is my first time on a hackathon and the goal is to see how far I can go.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

I've been a web developer for 8 years and have a strong background on Java and JS. User interface design is my main problem.

The goal is to develop a game that can be an entry point to anyone into the programming world.
