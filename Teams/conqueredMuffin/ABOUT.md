<em>My name is Emina Šahbegović, I am twenty-one years old and I am a second year student at International Burch Univercity in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia. I have decided to try and join the hackaton because I am a curious person and like to take as many 
opportunities as possible to gather more knowledge when it comes to programming. I have fallen in love with 
programming and would like to become one of the best programmers in this world, but since I started relatively late compared to 
my colleagues it will probably take some time till I get there. I would really like to become one of the best programmers for 
two reasons. First reason would have to be so I can pay my family everything back that they invested in me and finally be 
independent. The second reason is because I really respect smart people and would love to become a smart person who is needed 
in society.</em>

<h1><b>Abut your skills and what you are going to do?</b></h1>

<em>Since my skills in coding are still at a beginners level, it's possible that it won't kick people from their chairs but 
I will try to make the best project I've made yet. I do have some skills wehn it comes to design and art so hopefully it will 
make up a little for the lack of knowledge in coding. I will give the first theme a try and, hopefully, it will be interesting.</em>
