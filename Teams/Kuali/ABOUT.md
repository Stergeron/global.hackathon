
TEAM KUALI
==========

The word *kuali* in Ancient Mayan means *beautiful* and we like how it resembles the English word for **Quality**. That is what we are build: **beautiful and quality software**.

The ancient Mayans also predicted that we would win the Koding Hackathon, so let's hope this isn't 2012 all over again.
