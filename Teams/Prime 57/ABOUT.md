# Prime 57

We are Prime 57 and are passionate about making the web beautiful.

## About Us

We are a team of two. We have both been doing software engineering for over 5 years, and started at very young ages.

## Our Skills and Plans

We have both explored the many regions of computer engineering, from artificial intelligence, to Node.js, and have loved every minute, well except when we had to recompile gcc from source ;-)

We see the biggest problems in tech, the ones that everyone seems to avoid, but the difference is, weâ€™re not afraid to address them.
